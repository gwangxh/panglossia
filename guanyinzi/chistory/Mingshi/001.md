Paragraph 1:
太祖開天行道肇紀立極大聖至神仁文義武俊德成功高皇帝，諱元璋，字國瑞，姓朱氏。先世家沛，徙句容，再徙泗州。父世珍，始徙濠州之鐘離。生四子，太祖其季也。母陳氏，方娠，夢神授藥一丸，置掌中有光，吞之，寤，口餘香氣。及產，紅光滿室。自是夜數有光起，鄰里望見，驚以為火，輒奔救，至則無有。比長，姿貌雄傑，奇骨貫頂。志意廓然，人莫能測。

The Taizu Emperor, who opened the heavens and carried out the Tao, initiated the calendar and established the supreme virtue. His name was Yuanzhang, styled Guorui, and his surname was Zhu. His ancestors lived in Pei, moved to Jurong, and later to Sizhou. His father, Shizhen, first moved to Zhongli in Haozhou. He had four sons, with Taizu being the youngest. His mother, Madam Chen, had a dream during pregnancy where a deity gave her a glowing pill, which she swallowed. Upon waking, her mouth had a lingering fragrance. When Taizu was born, the room was filled with a red glow. From then on, lights frequently appeared at night, causing neighbors to think there was a fire and rush to help, only to find nothing. As he grew up, he had a majestic appearance and an extraordinary bone structure. His ambitions and intentions were vast and unfathomable.

Paragraph 2:
至正四年，旱蝗，大飢疫。太祖時年十七，父母兄相繼歿，貧不克葬。裡人劉繼祖與之地，乃克葬，即鳳陽陵也。太祖孤無所依，乃入皇覺寺為僧。逾月，游食合肥。道病，二紫衣人與俱，護視甚至。病已，失所在。凡歷光、固、汝、潁諸州三年，復還寺。當是時，元政不綱，盜賊四起。劉福通奉韓山童假宋後起潁，徐壽輝僭帝號起蘄，李二、彭大、趙均用起徐，眾各數萬，並置將帥，殺吏，侵略郡縣，而方國珍已先起海上。他盜擁兵據地，寇掠甚眾。天下大亂。

In the fourth year of Zhizheng, there was a severe drought and locust plague, leading to great famine and disease. At that time, Taizu was seventeen years old. His parents and brothers died in succession, and he was too poor to afford their burial. A local man named Liu Jizu provided land, allowing Taizu to bury his family at Fengyang Mausoleum. Taizu, being alone and with no one to rely on, entered Huangjue Temple and became a monk. After a month, he wandered for food in Hefei. On the way, he fell ill, and two men in purple clothes took care of him until he recovered. After recovering, they disappeared. He traveled through Guang, Gu, Ru, and Ying prefectures for three years before returning to the temple. At that time, the Yuan government was in disarray, and bandits rose up everywhere. Liu Futong supported Han Shantong, claiming to be a descendant of the Song dynasty, and started an uprising in Ying. Xu Shouhui declared himself emperor in Qi, and Li Er, Peng Da, and Zhao Junyong started uprisings in Xu, each with tens of thousands of followers. They appointed commanders, killed officials, and invaded counties, while Fang Guozhen had already risen in the coastal areas. Other bandits also gathered armies and seized territories, leading to widespread chaos.

Paragraph 3:
十二年春二月，定遠人郭子興與其黨孫德崖等起兵濠州。元將徹里不花憚不敢攻，而日俘良民以邀賞。太祖時年二十四，謀避兵，卜於神，去留皆不吉。乃曰：「得毋當舉大事乎？」卜之吉，大喜，遂以閏三月甲戌朔入濠見子興。子興奇其狀貌，留為親兵。戰輒勝，遂妻以所撫馬公女，即高皇后也。子興與德崖齟齬，太祖屢調護之。秋九月，元兵復徐州，李二走死，彭大、趙均用奔濠，德崖等納之。子興禮大而易均用，均用怨之。德崖遂與謀，伺子興出，執而械諸孫氏，將殺之。太祖方在淮北，聞難馳至，訴於彭大。大怒，呼兵以行，太祖亦甲而擁盾，發屋出子興，破械，使人負以歸，遂免。是冬，元將賈魯圍濠。太祖與子興力拒之。

In the twelfth year, in the second month of spring, Guo Zixing from Dingyuan, along with his follower Sun Deya and others, raised an army in Haozhou. The Yuan general Chelibuha was apprehensive and did not dare to attack, but captured good citizens daily to claim rewards. At that time, Taizu was twenty-four years old. Seeking to avoid the chaos, he consulted a deity, but received unfavorable omens whether to leave or stay. He then asked, "Should I undertake a great enterprise?" The omen was favorable, and he was overjoyed. On the first day of the intercalary third month, he went to Hao to see Zixing. Zixing was impressed by his appearance and kept him as a personal guard. Taizu always won in battle and was given Zixing's adopted daughter, the future Empress Gao, in marriage. Zixing and Sun Deya often quarreled, and Taizu repeatedly mediated. In the ninth month of autumn, Yuan troops retook Xuzhou. Li Er fled and died, while Peng Da and Zhao Junyong fled to Hao. Sun Deya and others accepted them. Zixing treated Peng Da respectfully but slighted Zhao Junyong, causing the latter to resent him. Sun Deya then plotted with Zhao Junyong, capturing Zixing and planning to kill him. Taizu, who was in Huaibei at the time, rushed to rescue Zixing, appealing to Peng Da. Peng Da was furious and mobilized troops. Taizu, donning armor and wielding a shield, broke into the house, freed Zixing, and carried him to safety, thus saving his life. That winter, the Yuan general Jia Lu besieged Hao. Taizu and Zixing resisted with all their might.

Paragraph 4:
十三年春，賈魯死，圍解。太祖收里中兵，得七百人。子興喜，署為鎮撫。時彭、趙所部暴橫，子興弱，太祖度無足與共事，乃以兵屬他將，獨與徐達、湯和、費聚等南略定遠。計降驢牌寨民兵三千，與俱東。夜襲元將張知院於橫澗山，收其卒二萬。道遇定遠人李善長，與語，大悅，遂與俱攻滁州，下之。是年，張士誠據高郵，自稱誠王。

In the thirteenth year, in spring, Jia Lu died, and the siege was lifted. Taizu gathered local soldiers, obtaining seven hundred men. Zixing was pleased and appointed him as a pacifier. At that time, Peng Da and Zhao Junyong's troops were rampant, and Zixing was weak. Taizu, seeing there was no one suitable to work with, assigned his troops to other generals and, together with Xu Da, Tang He, and Fei Ju, attacked Dingyuan in the south. They captured three thousand civilian soldiers at Lupai Village and moved east. They launched a night attack on the Yuan general Zhang Zhiyuan at Hengjian Mountain, capturing twenty thousand soldiers. On the way, they met Li Shanchang from Dingyuan and had a conversation, greatly delighting Taizu. They then attacked and captured Chuzhou together. That year, Zhang Shicheng seized Gaoyou and declared himself King Cheng.

Paragraph 5:
十四年冬十月，元丞相脫脫大敗士誠於高郵，分兵圍六合。太祖曰：「六合破，滁且不免。」與耿再成軍瓦梁壘，救之。力戰，衛老弱還滁。元兵尋大至，攻滁，太祖設伏誘敗之。然度元兵勢盛且再至，乃還所獲馬，遣父老具牛酒謝元將曰：「守城備他盜耳，奈何舍巨寇戮良民？」元兵引去，城賴以完。脫脫既破士誠，軍聲大振，會中讒，遽解兵柄，江淮亂益熾。

In the fourteenth year, in the tenth month of winter, the Yuan Chancellor Tuotuo defeated Zhang Shicheng at Gaoyou and divided his forces to besiege Liuhe. Taizu said, "If Liuhe falls, Chuzhou will not be spared." He and Geng Zaicheng led troops to Wa Liang Fort to rescue Liuhe. They fought fiercely, protecting the old and weak as they returned to Chuzhou. Yuan troops soon arrived in large numbers and attacked Chuzhou. Taizu set an ambush and defeated them. However, considering the strength of the Yuan forces and their likely return, he returned the captured horses and sent elders with cattle and wine to apologize to the Yuan general, saying, "We only defended the city against other bandits. Why abandon the great rebels to kill good citizens?" The Yuan troops withdrew, and the city was saved. After defeating Zhang Shicheng, Tuotuo's military prestige greatly increased, but he was soon slandered and relieved of command, leading to increased chaos in Jianghuai.

Paragraph 6:
十五年春正月，子興用太祖計，遣張天祐等拔和州，檄太祖總其軍。太祖慮諸將不相下，秘其檄，期旦日會廳事。時席尚右，諸將先入，皆踞右。太祖故後至，就左。比視事，剖決如流，眾瞠目不能發一語，始稍稍屈。議分工甓城，期三日。太祖工竣，諸將皆後。於是始出檄，南面坐曰：「奉命總諸公兵，今甓城皆後期，如軍法何？」諸將皆惶恐謝。乃搜軍中所掠婦女縱還家，民大悅。元兵十萬攻和，拒守三月，食且盡，而太子禿堅、樞密副使絆住馬、民兵元帥陳野先分屯新塘、高望、雞籠山以絕餉道。太祖率眾破之，元兵皆走渡江。三月，郭子興卒。時劉福通迎立韓山童子林兒於亳，國號宋，建元龍鳳。檄子興子天敘為都元帥，張天祐、太祖為左右副元帥。太祖慨然曰：「大丈夫寧能受制於人耶？」遂不受。然念林兒勢盛，可倚藉，乃用其年號以令軍中。

In the fifteenth year, in the first month of spring, Zixing used Taizu's strategy, sending Zhang Tianyou and others to capture Hezhou, and appointed Taizu to command the army. Taizu, worried that the generals would not submit to each other, kept the appointment secret and scheduled a meeting for the next morning. At the meeting, the seats on the right were considered superior, and the generals who arrived first all sat on the right. Taizu deliberately arrived late and sat on the left. When they started discussing affairs, he made decisions swiftly and skillfully, leaving the others speechless and gradually making them submit. They discussed dividing the work to build the city wall, with a deadline of three days. Taizu completed his task on time, while the other generals were delayed. He then revealed his appointment, sat facing south, and said, "I have been ordered to command your troops, but now the city wall is behind schedule. How should we handle this according to military law?" The generals were all frightened and apologized. Taizu then searched the army, released the women who had been captured, and sent them home, greatly pleasing the people. The Yuan army of one hundred thousand attacked Hezhou, besieging it for three months until food ran out. The Yuan prince Toghon Temür, Deputy Chief of the Secretariat Banzhuma, and civilian militia commander Chen Yexian split their forces to occupy Xintang, Gaowang, and Jilong Mountain to cut off supplies. Taizu led his troops to break their lines, and the Yuan soldiers fled across the river. In the third month, Guo Zixing died. At that time, Liu Futong welcomed Han Shantong's son Lin'er to Bozhou, proclaiming the Song dynasty and establishing the Longfeng era. He appointed Zixing's son Guo Tianxu as the Commander-in-Chief, with Zhang Tianyou and Taizu as the Left and Right Deputy Commanders. Taizu, feeling indignant, said, "How can a great man be subordinated to others?" and refused the position. However, recognizing Lin'er's strong position, he adopted Lin'er's era name for his own army.

Paragraph 7:
夏四月，常遇春來歸。五月，太祖謀渡江，無舟。會巢湖帥廖永安、俞通海以水軍千艘來附，太祖大喜，往撫其眾。而元中丞蠻子海牙扼銅城閘、馬場河諸隘，巢湖舟師不得出。忽大雨，太祖喜曰：「天助我也!」遂乘水漲，從小港縱舟還。因擊海牙於峪溪口，大敗之，遂定計渡江。諸將請直趨集慶。太祖曰：「取集慶必自採石始。採石重鎮，守必固，牛渚前臨大江，彼難為備，可必克也。」六月乙卯，乘風引帆，直達牛渚。常遇春先登，拔之。採石兵亦潰。緣江諸壘悉附。諸將以和州飢，爭取資糧謀歸。太祖謂徐達曰：「渡江幸捷，若舍而歸，江東非吾有也。」乃悉斷舟纜，放急流中，謂諸將曰：「太平甚近，當與公等取之。」遂乘勝拔太平，執萬戶納哈出。總管靳義赴水死，太祖曰：「義士也」，禮葬之。揭榜禁剽掠。有卒違令，斬以徇，軍中肅然。改路曰府。置太平興國翼元帥府，自領元帥事，召陶安參幕府事，李習為知府。時太平四面皆元兵。右丞阿魯灰、中丞蠻子海牙等嚴師截姑孰口，陳野先水軍帥康茂才以數萬眾攻城。太祖遣徐達、鄧愈、湯和逆戰，別將潛出其後，夾擊之，擒野先，並降其眾，阿魯灰等引去。秋九月，郭天敘、張天祐攻集慶，野先叛，二人皆戰死，於是子興部將盡歸太祖矣。野先尋 為民兵所殺，從子兆先收其眾，屯方山，與海牙掎角以窺太平。冬十二月壬子，釋納哈出北歸。
In the fourth month of summer, Chang Yuchun returned to serve. In May, Taizu planned to cross the river but had no boats. Coincidentally, commanders Liao Yong'an and Yu Tonghai from Lake Chao came with a fleet of a thousand boats to join him, greatly delighting Taizu. The Yuan Deputy Minister Manzi Haiya blocked the strategic points at Tongcheng Lock and Machang River, preventing the fleet from advancing. Suddenly, heavy rain fell, and Taizu exclaimed, "Heaven is helping me!" He took advantage of the rising water, launching his boats from a small port, and returned. He then defeated Haiya at Yuxi Mouth, planning to cross the river. The generals proposed to directly advance to Jiqing, but Taizu said, "To take Jiqing, we must start from Caishi. Caishi is a crucial stronghold, heavily guarded. Niuju faces the great river, making it difficult for the enemy to defend. We can certainly capture it." On the yichou day in June, they sailed with the wind, reaching Niuju directly. Chang Yuchun led the charge and captured it. The troops at Caishi also collapsed. The fortresses along the river all surrendered. The generals, concerned about famine in Hezhou, sought provisions and planned to return. Taizu said to Xu Da, "We successfully crossed the river. If we retreat now, Jiangdong will not be ours." He then ordered the cables to the boats cut and let them drift in the current, telling the generals, "Peace is near. We must capture it together." They then took advantage of their victory to capture Taiping, capturing the commandant Nahachu. The chief manager Jin Yi drowned himself. Taizu said, "He was a righteous man," and buried him with honor. He issued orders forbidding looting. Any soldier who disobeyed was executed as an example, instilling strict discipline in the army. He renamed the route as a prefecture, establishing the Taiping Xingguo Wing Marshal Prefecture and assuming the role of Marshal himself. He summoned Tao An to assist with administrative affairs and appointed Li Xi as the prefect. At that time, Taiping was surrounded by Yuan troops on all sides. Right Minister Aluhui and Deputy Minister Manzi Haiya stationed their troops at Gushoukou, while Chen Yexian's navy commander Kang Maocai led tens of thousands to attack the city. Taizu sent Xu Da, Deng Yu, and Tang He to counter-attack, while other generals secretly attacked from the rear, capturing Chen Yexian and making his troops surrender. Aluhui and others withdrew. In the ninth month of autumn, Guo Tianxu and Zhang Tianyou attacked Jiqing, but Chen Yexian rebelled, and both men were killed in battle. From then on, all of Zixing's generals submitted to Taizu. Chen Yexian was later killed by the civilian militia. His cousin Zhao Xianzhao gathered his troops, stationed at Fang Mountain, and joined Haiya in keeping an eye on Taiping. In the twelfth month of winter, on the renzi day, Nahachu was released and returned north.

Paragraph 8:
十六年春二月丙子，大破海牙於採石。三月癸未，進攻集慶，擒兆先，降其眾三萬六千人，皆疑懼不自保。太祖擇驍健者五百人入衛，解甲酣寢達旦，眾心始安。庚寅，再敗元兵於蔣山。元御史大夫福壽，力戰死之，蠻子海牙遁歸張士誠，康茂才降。太祖入城，悉召官吏父老諭之曰：「元政氵賣擾，干戈蜂起，我來為民除亂耳，其各安堵如故。賢士吾禮用之，舊政不便者除之，吏毋貪暴殃吾民。」民乃大喜過望。改集慶路為應天府，辟夏煜、孫炎、楊憲等十余人，葬御史大夫福壽，以旌其忠。
In the sixteenth year, in the second month of spring, on the bingzi day, Taizu severely defeated Manzi Haiya at Caishi. In March, on the guiyu day, they advanced to attack Jiqing, capturing Zhao Xianzhao and making his 36,000 troops surrender. They were all fearful and uncertain about their safety. Taizu selected 500 brave and strong men to serve as guards, then removed his armor and slept soundly until morning, putting the troops at ease. On the gengyin day, he defeated the Yuan troops again at Jiangshan. The Yuan Grand Councillor Fushou died fighting valiantly, while Manzi Haiya fled back to Zhang Shicheng, and Kang Maocai surrendered. Taizu entered the city, summoned officials and elders, and informed them, "The Yuan government's corruption and chaos have led to widespread conflict. I have come to eliminate the disorder for the people. Everyone should return to their usual activities. I will respect and employ virtuous scholars and remove the unsuitable old policies. Officials must not oppress or harm the people." The people were overjoyed. He renamed the Jiqing route to Yingtian Prefecture, appointed Xia Yu, Sun Yan, Yang Xian, and over ten others, and buried Grand Councillor Fushou to honor his loyalty.

Paragraph 9:
當是時，元將定定扼鎮江，別不華、楊仲英屯寧國，青衣軍張明鑒據揚州，八思爾不花駐徽州，石抹宜孫守處州，其弟厚孫守婺州，宋伯顏不花守衢州，而池州已為徐壽輝將所據，張士誠自淮東陷平江，轉掠浙西。太祖既定集慶，慮士誠、壽輝強，江左、浙右諸郡為所並，於是遣徐達攻鎮江，拔之，定定戰死。夏六月，鄧 愈克廣德。
At that time, the Yuan general Dingding was guarding Zhenjiang, while Bie Buhua and Yang Zhongying were stationed at Ningguo. The Green-clad Army under Zhang Mingjian occupied Yangzhou

, Basi'er Buhua was stationed in Huizhou, Shimo Yisun guarded Chuzhou, and his brother Housun guarded Wuzhou. Song Boyan Buhua was in charge of Quzhou, while Chizhou was already occupied by Xu Shouhui's generals. Zhang Shicheng, after capturing Pingjiang from Huai East, moved on to plunder Western Zhejiang. After securing Jiqing, Taizu, worried about the strength of Zhang Shicheng and Xu Shouhui, and the potential threat to the counties of Jiangzuo and Zheyou, sent Xu Da to attack Zhenjiang, capturing it and killing Dingding in battle. In the sixth month of summer, Deng Yu captured Guangde.

Paragraph 10:
秋七月己卯，諸將奉太祖為吳國公。置江南行中書省，自總省事，置僚佐。貽書張士誠，士誠不報，引兵攻鎮江。徐達敗之，進圍常州，不下。九月戊寅，如鎮江，謁孔子廟。遣儒士告諭父老，勸農桑，尋還應天。
In the seventh month of autumn, on the yimao day, the generals acclaimed Taizu as Duke of Wu. He established the Jiangnan Branch Secretariat, personally overseeing provincial affairs and appointing aides. He sent a letter to Zhang Shicheng, but received no reply. Zhang Shicheng led his troops to attack Zhenjiang, but Xu Da defeated him and advanced to besiege Changzhou, though they could not capture it. In the ninth month, on the wuyin day, Taizu visited Zhenjiang, paid respects at the Confucius Temple, sent scholars to inform the elders, and encouraged agriculture and sericulture, before returning to Yingtian.

Paragraph 11:
十七年春二月，耿炳文克長興。三月，徐達克常州。夏四月丁卯，自將攻寧國，取之，別不華降。五月，上元、寧國、句容獻瑞麥。六月，趙繼祖克江陰。秋七月，徐達克常熟。胡大海克徽州，八思爾不花遁。冬十月，常遇春克池州，繆大亨克揚州，張明鑒降。十二月己丑，釋囚。是年，徐壽輝將明玉珍據重慶路。
In the seventeenth year, in the second month of spring, Geng Bingwen captured Changxing. In March, Xu Da captured Changzhou. In the fourth month of summer, on the dingmao day, Taizu personally led an attack on Ningguo and captured it, causing Bie Buhua to surrender. In May, auspicious wheat was presented from Shangyuan, Ningguo, and Jurong. In June, Zhao Jizu captured Jiangyin. In the seventh month of autumn, Xu Da captured Changshu. Hu Dahai captured Huizhou, causing Basi'er Buhua to flee. In the tenth month of winter, Chang Yuchun captured Chizhou, and Miao Daheng captured Yangzhou, with Zhang Mingjian surrendering. In the twelfth month, on the jichou day, prisoners were released. That year, Xu Shouhui's general Ming Yuzhen occupied Chongqing.

Paragraph 12:
十八年春二月乙亥，以康茂才為營田使。三月己酉，錄囚。鄧愈克建德路。夏四月，徐壽輝將陳友諒遣趙普勝陷池州。是月，友諒據龍興路。五月，劉福通破汴梁，迎韓林兒都之。初，福通遣將分道四齣，破山東，寇秦晉，掠幽薊，中原大亂，太祖故得次第略定江表。所過不殺，收召才雋，由是人心日附。冬十二月，胡大海攻婺州，久不下，太祖自將往擊之。石抹宜孫遣將率車師由松溪來援，太祖曰：「道狹，車戰適取敗耳。」命胡德濟迎戰於梅花門，大破之，婺州降，執厚孫。先一日，城中人望見城西五色雲如車蓋，以為異，及是乃知為太祖駐兵地。入城，發粟振貧民，改州為寧越府。辟范祖干、葉儀、許元等十三人分直講經史。戊子，遣使招諭方國珍。
In the eighteenth year, in the second month of spring, on the yihai day, Kang Maocai was appointed as the Commissioner of Agricultural Affairs. In March, on the jiyou day, prisoners were recorded. Deng Yu captured Jiande Road. In the fourth month of summer, Xu Shouhui's general Chen Youliang sent Zhao Pusheng to capture Chizhou. That month, Youliang occupied Longxing Road. In May, Liu Futong broke through Bianliang, welcoming Han Lin'er to establish the capital there. Initially, Liu Futong sent generals in four directions, conquering Shandong, attacking Qin and Jin, and plundering You and Ji, causing great chaos in the Central Plains. This allowed Taizu to gradually secure Jiangbiao. He did not kill as he advanced, recruiting talented people, thus winning the hearts of the people. In the twelfth month of winter, Hu Dahai attacked Wuzhou but could not capture it for a long time. Taizu personally led an attack. Shimo Yisun sent a general with chariot troops through Songxi to aid Wuzhou. Taizu said, "The road is narrow, and chariot warfare will only lead to defeat." He ordered Hu Deji to intercept at Meihuamen, achieving a great victory. Wuzhou surrendered, and Housun was captured. The day before, people in the city saw five-colored clouds in the west like a canopy, considering it an omen, which was realized when Taizu's troops arrived. Entering the city, he distributed grain to aid the poor, renaming the prefecture to Ningyue Prefecture. He appointed Fan Zugan, Ye Yi, Xu Yuan, and thirteen others to lecture on the classics and history. On the wuzi day, he sent an envoy to summon Fang Guozhen.

Paragraph 13:
十九年春正月乙巳，太祖謀取浙東未下諸路。戒諸將曰：「克城以武，戡亂以仁。吾比入集慶，秋毫無犯，故一舉而定。每聞諸將得一城不妄殺，輒喜不自勝。夫師行如火，不戢將燎原。為將能以不殺為武，豈惟國家之利，子孫實受其福。」庚申，胡大海克諸暨。是月，命寧越知府王宗顯立郡學。三月甲午，赦大逆以下。丁巳，方國珍以溫、台、慶元來獻，遣其子關為質，不受。夏四月，俞通海等復池州。時耿炳文守長興，吳良守江陰，湯和守常州，皆數敗士誠兵。太祖以故久留寧越，徇浙東。六月壬戌，還應天。秋八月，元察罕帖木兒復汴梁，福通以林兒退保安豐。九月，常遇春克衢州，擒宋伯顏不花。冬十月，遣夏煜授方國珍行省平章，國珍以疾辭。十一月壬寅，胡大海克處州，石抹宜孫遁。時元守兵單弱，且聞中原亂，人心離散，以故江左、浙右諸郡，兵至皆下，遂西與友諒鄰。
In the nineteenth year, in the first month of spring, on the yisi day, Taizu planned to conquer the remaining routes in Eastern Zhejiang. He warned the generals, "Conquer cities with military might, but quell chaos with benevolence. When we entered Jiqing, we did not harm a single hair, and thus secured it in one stroke. Whenever I hear that a general has captured a city without unnecessary killing, I am overjoyed. An army moves like fire; if not restrained, it will spread uncontrollably. A general who can achieve victory without killing brings not only benefits to the state but also blessings to his descendants." On the gengshen day, Hu Dahai captured Zhuji. That month, he ordered Ningyue Prefect Wang Zongxian to establish a county school. In March, on the jiawu day, he

 pardoned those who had committed major crimes. On the dingsi day, Fang Guozhen presented offerings from Wen, Tai, and Qingyuan, sending his son Guan as a hostage, but Taizu did not accept. In the fourth month of summer, Yu Tonghai and others recaptured Chizhou. At that time, Geng Bingwen guarded Changxing, Wu Liang guarded Jiangyin, and Tang He guarded Changzhou, all frequently defeating Zhang Shicheng's troops. Taizu, therefore, stayed longer in Ningyue, advancing through Eastern Zhejiang. On the renxu day in June, he returned to Yingtian. In the eighth month of autumn, Yuan General Chahan Temur recaptured Bianliang, forcing Liu Futong to retreat to Anfeng with Lin'er. In September, Chang Yuchun captured Quzhou, seizing Song Boyan Buhua. In the tenth month of winter, he sent Xia Yu to appoint Fang Guozhen as Provincial Governor, but Guozhen declined due to illness. On the renyin day in November, Hu Dahai captured Chuzhou, causing Shimo Yisun to flee. At that time, the Yuan defensive forces were weak, and with the turmoil in the Central Plains and the people's discontent, the counties of Jiangzuo and Zheyou surrendered upon the arrival of troops, eventually leading to proximity with Chen Youliang in the west.

Paragraph 14:
二十年春二月，元福建行省參政袁天祿以福寧降。三月戊子，征劉基、宋濂、章溢、葉琛至。夏五月，徐達、常遇春敗陳友諒於池州。閏月丙辰，友諒陷太平，守將硃文遜，院判花雲、王鼎，知府許瑗死之。未幾，友諒弒其主徐壽輝，自稱皇帝，國號漢，盡有江西、湖廣地，約士誠合攻應天，應天大震。諸將議先復太平以牽之，太祖曰：「不可。彼居上游，舟師十倍於我，猝難復也。」或請自將迎擊，太祖曰：「不可。彼以偏師綴我，而全軍趨金陵，順流半日可達，吾步騎急難引還，百里趨戰，兵法所忌，非策也。」乃馳諭胡大海搗信州牽其後，而令康茂才以書紿友諒，令速來。友諒果引兵東。於是常遇春伏石灰山，徐達陣南門外，楊璟屯大勝港，張德勝等以舟師出龍江關，太祖親督軍盧龍山。乙丑，友諒至龍灣，眾欲戰，太祖曰：「天且雨，趣食，乘雨擊之。」須臾，果大雨，士卒競奮，雨止合戰，水陸夾擊，大破之，友諒乘別舸走。遂復太平，下安慶，而大海亦克信州。初，太祖令茂才紿友諒，李善長以為疑。太祖曰：「二寇合，吾首尾受敵，惟速其來而先破之，則士誠膽落矣。」已而士誠兵竟不出。丁卯，置儒學提舉司，以宋濂為提舉，遣子標受經學。六月，耿再成敗石抹宜孫於慶元，宜孫戰死，遣使祭之。秋九月，徐壽輝舊將歐普祥以袁州降。冬十二月，復遣夏煜以書諭國珍。
In the twentieth year, in the second month of spring, Yuan Tianlu, the associate administrator of the Yuan Fujian Provincial Secretariat, surrendered with Funing. In March, on the wuxi day, he summoned Liu Ji, Song Lian, Zhang Yi, and Ye Chen. In May of summer, Xu Da and Chang Yuchun defeated Chen Youliang at Chizhou. During the intercalary month, on the bingchen day, Youliang captured Taiping, killing the defending commander Zhu Wenxun, the judicial officers Hua Yun and Wang Ding, and the prefect Xu Yuan. Shortly thereafter, Youliang murdered his lord Xu Shouhui and declared himself emperor, establishing the Han state and occupying Jiangxi and Huguang. He allied with Zhang Shicheng to attack Yingtian, causing great alarm. The generals suggested first recapturing Taiping to draw him out, but Taizu said, "No, he holds the upper hand and his navy is ten times ours; it is difficult to recapture swiftly." Some proposed confronting him directly, but Taizu said, "No, he would use a detachment to delay us while his main force attacks Jinling, reaching it in half a day with the current. Our infantry and cavalry would struggle to return, and engaging an enemy after a forced march is against military principles." Instead, he ordered Hu Dahai to raid Xinzhuo, forcing Youliang to respond. Kang Maocai sent a deceptive letter to Youliang, urging him to advance quickly. Youliang took the bait, moving his troops eastward. Chang Yuchun ambushed at Lime Mountain, Xu Da deployed outside the south gate, Yang Jing stationed at Dasheng Port, and Zhang Desheng's navy blocked Longjiang Pass. Taizu personally commanded at Lulong Mountain. On the yichou day, Youliang arrived at Longwan. His troops wanted to engage, but Taizu said, "It will rain soon; eat quickly and attack after the rain." Indeed, heavy rain soon fell. The soldiers, inspired, attacked fiercely after the rain stopped, achieving a major victory. Youliang fled in a small boat. They recaptured Taiping and took Anqing, while Dahai also seized Xinzhuo. Initially, Taizu's ruse involving Kang Maocai was doubted by Li Shanchang. Taizu said, "If the two enemies join forces, we will be attacked from both ends. Only by luring him quickly and defeating him first will Zhang Shicheng lose courage." Zhang Shicheng's troops ultimately did not engage. On the dingmao day, he established the Department of Confucian Education, appointing Song Lian as the director and sending his son Biao to study. In June, Geng Zaicheng defeated Shimo Yisun at Qingyuan. Yisun died in battle, and Taizu sent envoys to honor him. In September of autumn, Xu Shouhui's former general Ou Puxiang surrendered with Yuanzhou. In December of winter, he sent Xia Yu with a letter to summon Fang Guozhen.

Paragraph 15:
二十一年春二月甲申，立鹽茶課。己亥，置寶源局。三月丁丑，改樞密院為大都督府。元將薛顯以泗州降。戊寅，國珍遣使來謝，飾金玉馬鞍以獻。卻之曰：「今有事四方，所需者人材，所用者粟帛，寶玩非所好也。」秋七月，友諒將張定邊陷安慶。八月，遣使於元平章察罕帖木兒。時察罕平山東，降田豐，軍聲大振，故太祖與通好。會察罕方攻益都未下，太祖乃自將舟師征陳友諒。戊戌，克安慶，友諒將丁普郎、傅友德迎降。壬寅，次湖口，追敗友諒於江州，克其城，友諒奔武昌。分徇南康、建昌、饒、蘄、黃、廣濟，皆下。冬十一月己未，克撫州。
In the twenty-first year, in the second month of spring, on the jiashen day, a tax on salt and tea was established. On the jihai day, the Bao Yuan Bureau was established. In March, on the dingchou day, the Privy Council was restructured into the Grand Governor's Office. Yuan General Xue Xian surrendered with Sizhou. On the wuyin day, Fang Guozhen sent an envoy with a golden and jade saddle as a gift. Taizu declined, saying, "Now that we have affairs in all directions, what we need are talented people and supplies of grain and silk, not treasures." In July of autumn, Chen Youliang's general Zhang Dingbian captured Anqing. In August, an envoy was sent to the Yuan's Chancellor Chahan Temur. At that time, Chahan had pacified Shandong and accepted Tian Feng's surrender, greatly boosting his military prestige. Therefore, Taizu sought friendly relations. When Chahan was attacking Yidu and had not yet succeeded, Taizu personally led a naval expedition against Chen Youliang. On the wuxu day, he captured Anqing. Youliang's generals Ding Pulang and Fu Youde surrendered. On the renyin day, they advanced to Hukou and pursued and defeated Youliang at Jiangzhou, capturing the city, and Youliang fled to Wuchang. They then pacified Nankang, Jianchang, Rao, Qi, Huang, and Guangji, all of which surrendered. In the eleventh month of winter, on the jimao day, they captured Fuzhou.

Paragraph 16:
二十二年春正月，友諒江西行省丞相胡廷瑞以龍興降。乙卯，如龍興，改為洪都府。謁孔子廟。告諭父老，除陳氏苛政，罷諸軍需，存恤貧無告者，民大悅。袁、瑞、臨江、吉安相繼下。二月，還應天。鄧愈留守洪都。癸未，降人蔣英殺金華守將胡大海，郎中王愷死之，英叛降張士誠。處州降人李祐之聞變，亦殺行樞密院判耿再成反，都事孫炎、知府王道同、元帥硃文剛死之。三月癸亥，降人祝宗、康泰反，陷洪都，鄧愈走應天，知府葉琛、都事萬思誠死之。是月，明玉珍稱帝於重慶，國號夏。夏四月己卯，邵榮復處州。甲午，徐達復洪都。五月丙午，硃文正、趙德勝、鄧愈鎮洪都。六月戊寅，察罕以書來報，留我使人不遣。察罕尋為田豐所殺。秋七月丙辰，平章邵榮、參政趙繼祖謀逆，伏誅。冬十二月，元遣尚書張昶航海至慶元，授太祖江西行省平章政事，不受。察罕子擴廓帖木兒致書歸使者。
In the twenty-second year, in the first month of spring, Chen Youliang's Vice Minister of Jiangxi, Hu Tingrui, surrendered with Longxing. On the yimao day, they entered Longxing and renamed it Hongdu Prefecture. Taizu visited the Confucius Temple, informed the elders, abolished the harsh policies of the Chen regime, stopped all military requisitions, and took care of the poor and helpless, greatly pleasing the people. Yuan, Rui, Linjiang, and Jian all surrendered one after another. In February, Taizu returned to Yingtian, leaving Deng Yu to guard Hongdu. On the guwei day, the traitor Jiang Ying killed the commander of Jinhua, Hu Dahai, and Lord Wang Kai died defending him. Jiang Ying then defected to Zhang Shicheng. In Chuzhou, the defector Li Youzhi, upon hearing the news, also killed the Deputy Chief of the Privy Council Geng Zaicheng, Secretary Sun Yan, Prefect Wang Dao, and Marshal Zhu Wengang. In March, on the guihai day, the defectors Zhu Zong and Kang Tai rebelled and seized Hongdu. Deng Yu fled to Yingtian, while Prefect Ye Chen and Secretary Wan Sicong died defending the city. That month, Ming Yuzhen declared himself emperor in Chongqing, establishing the Xia state. In the fourth month of summer, on the jimao day, Shao Rong recaptured Chuzhou. On the jiawu day, Xu Da recaptured Hongdu. In May, on the bingwu day, Zhu Wenzheng, Zhao Desheng, and Deng Yu were stationed at Hongdu. In June, on the wuyin day, Chahan sent a letter, detaining the envoy. Chahan was soon killed by Tian Feng. In July of autumn, on the bingchen day, Chancellor Shao Rong and Associate Administrator Zhao Jizu were executed for treason. In December of winter, the Yuan government sent Minister Zhang Chang to sail to Qingyuan, appointing Taizu as the Provincial Governor of Jiangxi, but he declined. Chahan's son, Kuo Kuo Temur, sent a letter returning the envoy.

Paragraph 17:
二十三年春正月丙寅，遣汪河報之。二月壬申，命將士屯田積谷。是月，友諒將張定邊陷饒州。士誠將呂珍破安豐，殺劉福通。三月辛丑，太祖自將救安豐，珍敗走，以韓林兒歸滁州，乃還應天。夏四月壬戌，友諒大舉兵圍洪都。乙丑，諸全守將謝再興叛，附於士誠。五月，築禮賢館。友諒分兵陷吉安，參政劉齊、知府硃叔華死之。陷臨江，同知趙天麟死之。陷無為州，知州董會死之。秋七月癸酉，太祖自將救洪都。癸未，次湖口，先伏兵涇江口及南湖觜，遏友諒歸路，檄信州兵守武陽渡。友諒聞太祖至，解圍，逆戰於鄱陽湖。友諒兵號六十萬，聯巨舟為陣，樓櫓高十余丈，綿亙數十里，旌旗戈盾，望之如山。丁亥，遇於康郎山，太祖分軍十一隊以御之。戊子，合戰，徐達擊其前鋒，俞通海以火砲焚其舟數十，殺傷略相當。友諒驍將張定邊直犯太祖舟，舟膠於沙，不得退，危甚，常遇春從旁射中定邊，通海復來援，舟驟進，水涌太祖舟，乃得脫。己丑，友諒悉巨艦出戰，諸將舟小，仰攻不利，有怖色。太祖親麾之，不前，斬退縮者十余人，人皆殊死戰。會日晡，大風起東北，乃命敢死士操七舟，實火藥蘆葦中，縱火焚友諒舟。風烈火熾，煙焰漲天，湖水盡赤。友諒兵大亂，諸將鼓噪乘之，斬首二千余級，焚溺死者無算，友諒氣奪。辛卯，復戰，友諒復大敗。於是斂舟自守，不敢更戰。壬辰，太祖移軍扼左蠡，友諒亦退保渚磯。相持三日，其左、右二金吾將軍皆降。友諒勢益蹙，忿甚，盡殺所獲將士。而太祖則悉還所俘，傷者傅以善藥，且祭其親戚諸將陣亡者。八月壬戌，友諒食盡，趨南湖觜，為南湖軍所遏，遂突湖口。太祖邀之，順流搏戰，及於涇江。涇江軍復遮擊之，友諒中流矢死。張定邊以其子理奔武昌。九月，還應天，論功行賞。先是，太祖救安豐，劉基諫不聽。至是謂基曰：「我不當有安豐之行。使友諒乘虛直搗應天，大事去矣。乃頓兵南昌，不亡何待。友諒亡，天下不難定也。」壬午，自將征陳理。是月，張士誠自稱吳王。冬十月壬寅，圍武昌，分徇湖北諸路，皆下。十二月丙申，還應天，常遇春留督諸軍。
In the twenty-third year, in the first month of spring, on the bingshen day, Wang He was sent to report. In February, on the renshen day, soldiers were ordered to farm and store grain. That month, Chen Youliang's general Zhang Dingbian captured Raozhou. Zhang Shicheng's general Lu Zhen defeated Anfeng, killing Liu Futong. In March, on the xinchou day, Taizu personally led a campaign to save Anfeng. Lu Zhen fled, taking Han Lin'er to Chuzhou, and then returned to Yingtian. In April of summer, on the renxu day, Chen Youliang besieged Hongdu with a large army. On the yichou day, General Xie Zaixing of Zhuquan defected to Zhang Shicheng. In May, a Hall of Virtue was constructed. Youliang's troops captured Jian, killing Vice Minister Liu Qi and Prefect Zhu Shuhua. They captured Linjiang, killing Vice Prefect Zhao Tianlin. They captured Wuwei, killing Prefect Dong Hui. In July of autumn, on the guiyou day, Taizu personally led a campaign to save Hongdu. On the guihai day, they camped at Hukou, setting up ambushes at Jingjiangkou and Nanhuzui to block Youliang's retreat, ordering Xinzhuo troops to guard Wuyang Pass. Hearing of Taizu's arrival, Youliang lifted the siege and fought at Poyang Lake. Youliang's army, numbering 600,000, formed a massive fleet with tall towers over ten stories high, stretching for tens of miles, with flags and shields like mountains. On the dinghai day, they encountered each other at Kanglang Mountain. Taizu divided his forces into eleven squads to confront them. On the wuzi day, they engaged in battle, with Xu Da attacking the vanguard and Yu Tonghai using fire cannons

 to burn dozens of ships, causing significant casualties. Youliang's fierce general Zhang Dingbian directly attacked Taizu's boat, which got stuck in the sand and couldn't retreat, causing great danger. Chang Yuchun shot Zhang Dingbian from the side, and Tonghai came to assist, allowing Taizu's boat to escape. On the jichou day, Youliang brought out his giant ships to fight. The smaller boats struggled to attack, showing fear. Taizu personally directed the battle, killing over ten retreating soldiers, forcing everyone to fight to the death. In the late afternoon, a strong northeast wind arose. Taizu ordered brave soldiers to load seven boats with gunpowder and reeds, setting them on fire and burning Youliang's ships. The wind fueled the flames, sending smoke and fire skyward, turning the lake red. Youliang's troops fell into chaos, and the generals took advantage, killing over 2,000 and causing countless deaths by burning and drowning. Youliang lost his morale. On the xinmao day, they fought again, and Youliang was defeated once more. He then gathered his ships to defend and dared not engage further. On the renchen day, Taizu moved his troops to Zuo Li, while Youliang retreated to Zhujia. After three days, his two generals surrendered. Youliang's situation became increasingly desperate. In his fury, he killed all captured soldiers. Taizu, however, returned all captives, treated the wounded with good medicine, and honored the fallen generals and soldiers with sacrifices. On the renxu day of August, Youliang, running out of food, fled to Nanhuzui, where he was blocked by the Nanhuzui army. He broke through to Hukou. Taizu intercepted him, fighting downstream to Jingjiang. The Jingjiang army blocked him again, and Youliang was shot by an arrow and died. Zhang Dingbian fled to Wuchang with his son Li. In September, Taizu returned to Yingtian, rewarding those who had merited. Earlier, Liu Ji had advised against the Anfeng campaign, which Taizu ignored. Taizu then told Ji, "I shouldn't have gone to Anfeng. If Youliang had taken advantage of our absence to attack Yingtian directly, it would have been a disaster. But he besieged Nanchang instead, and his downfall was inevitable. With Youliang gone, unifying the realm will not be difficult." On the renwu day, Taizu led a campaign against Chen Li. That month, Zhang Shicheng declared himself King of Wu. In the tenth month of winter, on the renyin day, they besieged Wuchang, subduing all routes in Hubei. In December, on the bingshen day, Taizu returned to Yingtian, leaving Chang Yuchun to oversee the troops.

Paragraph 18:
二十四年春正月丙寅朔，李善長等率群臣勸進，不允。固請，乃即吳王位。建百官。以善長為右相國，徐達為左相國，常遇春、俞通海為平章政事，諭之曰：「立國之初，當先正紀綱。元氏暗弱，威福下移，馴至於亂，今宜鑒之。」立子標為世子。二月乙未，復自將征武昌，陳理降，漢、沔、荊、岳皆下。三月乙丑，還應天。丁卯，置起居注。庚午，罷諸翼元帥府，置十七衛親軍指揮使司，命中書省辟文武人材。夏四月，建祠，祀死事丁普郎等於康郎山，趙德勝等於南昌。秋七月丁丑，徐達克盧州。戊寅，常遇春徇江西。八月戊戌，復吉安，遂圍贛州。達徇荊、湘諸路。九月甲申，下江陵，夷陵、潭、歸皆降。冬十二月庚寅，達克辰州，遣別將下衡州。
In the twenty-fourth year, in the first month of spring, on the bingyin day, Li Shanchang and others led the ministers to urge Taizu to ascend the throne, but he refused. They insisted, so he accepted the title of King of Wu. He established the government, appointing Shanchang as Right Prime Minister, Xu Da as Left Prime Minister, and Chang Yuchun and Yu Tonghai as Chiefs of State Affairs, advising them, "At the founding of the nation, we must first set proper regulations. The Yuan dynasty's downfall was due to their weak and corrupt governance. We must learn from this." He established his son Biao as the heir apparent. In February, on the yiwei day, he personally led a campaign against Wuchang, and Chen Li surrendered, with Han, Mian, Jing, and Yue all submitting. In March, on the yichou day, he returned to Yingtian. On the dingmao day, he established the position of recorder of daily events. On the gengwu day, he abolished the wing marshal offices and established the Seventeen Guards Command, ordering the Central Secretariat to recruit talented civil and military personnel. In April of summer, he built a shrine to honor the fallen Ding Pulang and others at Kanglang Mountain, and Zhao Desheng and others at Nanchang. In July of autumn, on the dingchou day, Xu Da captured Luzhou. On the wuyin day, Chang Yuchun pacified Jiangxi. In August, on the wuwu day, they recaptured Jian and then besieged Ganzhou. Xu Da pacified the routes of Jing and Xiang. In September, on the jiashen day, they captured Jiangling, with Yiling, Tan, and Gui all surrendering. In December of winter, on the gengyin day, Xu Da captured Chenzhou, and another general was sent to capture Hengzhou.

Paragraph 19:
二十五年春正月己巳，徐達下寶慶，湖湘平。常遇春克贛州，熊天瑞降。遂趨南安，招諭嶺南諸路，下韶州、南雄。甲申，如南昌，執大都督硃文正以歸，數其罪，安置桐城。二月己丑，福建行省平章陳友定侵處州，參軍胡深擊敗之，遂下浦城。丙午，士誠將李伯升攻諸全之新城，李文忠大敗之。夏四月庚寅，常遇春徇襄、漢諸路。五月乙亥，克安陸。己卯，下襄陽。六月壬子，硃亮祖、胡深攻建寧，戰於城下，深被執，死之。秋七月，令從渡江士卒被創廢疾者養之，死者贍其妻子。九月丙辰，建國子學。冬十月戊戌，下令討張士誠。是時，士誠所據，南至紹興，北有通、泰、高郵、淮安、濠、泗，又北至於濟寧。乃命徐達、常遇春等先規取淮東。閏月，圍泰州，克之。十一月，張士誠寇宜興，徐達擊敗之，遂自宜興還攻高郵。
In the twenty-fifth year, in the first month of spring, on the jisi day, Xu Da captured Baoqing, pacifying Hunan and Hubei. Chang Yuchun captured Ganzhou, and Xiong Tianrui surrendered. They then advanced to Nan'an, summoning the routes of Lingnan, capturing Shaozhou and Nanhua. On the jiashen day, they arrived in Nanchang, arresting the Grand Marshal Zhu Wenzheng and returning him for trial, where he was exiled to Tongcheng. In February, on the jichou day, the Chief of the Fujian Provincial Secretariat, Chen Youding, invaded Chuzhou, but the military adviser Hu Shen defeated him, capturing Pucheng. On the bingwu day, Zhang Shicheng's general Li Bosheng attacked Zhuquan's new city, but Li Wenzhong defeated him. In April of summer, on the gengyin day, Chang Yuchun pacified the routes of Xiang and Han. In May, on the yihai day, they captured Anlu. On the jimao day, they captured Xiangyang. In June, on the renzi day, Zhu Liangzu and Hu Shen attacked Jianning, battling under the city walls, where Hu Shen was captured and killed. In July of autumn, soldiers wounded or disabled from crossing the river were ordered to be cared for, and the families of the deceased were supported. In September, on the bingchen day, they established a national school. In October of winter, on the wuwu day, orders were issued to attack Zhang Shicheng. At that time, Zhang Shicheng controlled

 territory south to Shaoxing, north to Tong, Tai, Gaoyou, Huai'an, Hao, and Si, and further north to Jining. Xu Da and Chang Yuchun were ordered to first target Huaidong. During the intercalary month, they besieged Taizhou and captured it. In November, Zhang Shicheng attacked Yixing, but Xu Da defeated him, and then returned to attack Gaoyou from Yixing.

Paragraph 20:
二十六年春正月癸未，士誠窺江陰，太祖自將救之，士誠遁，康茂才追敗之於浮子門。太祖還應天。二月，明玉珍死，子升自立。三月丙申，令中書嚴選舉。徐達克高郵。夏四月乙卯，襲破士誠將徐義水軍於淮安，義遁，梅思祖以城降。濠、徐、宿三州相繼下，淮東平。甲子，如濠州省墓，置守冢二十家，賜故人汪文、劉英粟帛。置酒召父老飲，極歡，曰：「吾去鄉十有余年，艱難百戰，乃得歸省墳墓，與父老子弟復相見。今苦不得久留歡聚為樂。父老幸教子弟孝弟力田，毋遠賈，濱淮郡縣尚苦寇掠，父老善自愛。」令有司除租賦，皆頓首謝。辛未，徐達克安豐，分兵敗擴廓於徐州。夏五月壬午，至自濠。庚寅，求遺書。秋八月庚戌，改築應天城，作新宮鐘山之陽。辛亥，命徐達為大將軍，常遇春為副將軍，帥師二十萬討張士誠。御戟門誓師曰：「城下之日，毋殺掠，毋毀廬舍，毋發丘壟。士誠母葬平江城外，毋侵毀。」既而召問達、遇春，用兵當何先。遇春欲直搗平江。太祖曰：「湖州張天騏、杭州潘原明為士誠臂指，平江窮蹙，兩人悉力赴援，難以取勝。不若先攻湖州，使疲於奔命。羽翼既披，平江勢孤，立破矣。」甲戌，敗張天騏於湖州，士誠親率兵來援，覆敗之於皁林。九月乙未，李文忠攻杭州。冬十月壬子，遇春敗士誠兵於烏鎮。十一月甲申，張天騏降。辛卯，李文忠下余杭，潘原明降，旁郡悉下。癸卯，圍平江。十二月，韓林兒卒。以明年為吳元年，建廟社宮室，祭告山川。所司進宮殿圖，命去雕琢奇麗者。是歲，元擴廓帖木兒與李思齊、張良弼構怨，屢相攻擊，朝命不行，中原民益困。
In the twenty-sixth year, in the first month of spring, on the guiwei day, Zhang Shicheng eyed Jiangyin, and Taizu personally led a rescue mission, causing Zhang Shicheng to flee. Kang Maocai pursued and defeated him at Fuzimen. Taizu returned to Yingtian. In February, Ming Yuzhen died, and his son Sheng proclaimed himself emperor. In March, on the bingshen day, the Central Secretariat was ordered to conduct strict examinations. Xu Da captured Gaoyou. In April of summer, on the yimao day, he ambushed and defeated Zhang Shicheng's general Xu Yi's navy at Huai'an, causing Xu Yi to flee. Mei Sizhu surrendered the city. The prefectures of Hao, Xu, and Su successively fell, and Huaidong was pacified. On the jiazi day, Taizu visited Haozhou to pay respects at his ancestors' tombs, establishing twenty households to guard the tombs and granting grain and silk to his old friends Wang Wen and Liu Ying. He held a banquet for the elders, expressing great joy, saying, "I have been away from home for over ten years, enduring hardships and battles, and now I can finally return to pay respects at the tombs and reunite with the elders and children. Unfortunately, I cannot stay long to enjoy the reunion. Elders, please teach the children to be filial and hardworking, not to trade far away. The counties along the Huai River still suffer from banditry; take care of yourselves." He ordered the officials to exempt taxes, and they all bowed in gratitude. On the xinwei day, Xu Da captured Anfeng and divided his forces to defeat Kuo Kuo Temur at Xuzhou. In May of summer, on the renwu day, he returned from Haozhou. On the gengyin day, he sought lost books. In August of autumn, on the gengxu day, he rebuilt Yingtian city, constructing a new palace on the south side of Zhongshan. On the xinhai day, Xu Da was appointed as Grand General, and Chang Yuchun as Deputy General, leading an army of 200,000 to attack Zhang Shicheng. At the Yujimen, Taizu swore to the troops, "When the city falls, do not kill or loot, do not destroy houses, do not dig up graves. Zhang Shicheng's mother is buried outside Pingjiang city; do not disturb her tomb." He then asked Xu Da and Chang Yuchun about their military strategy. Chang Yuchun suggested a direct attack on Pingjiang. Taizu said, "Zhang Tianqi in Huzhou and Pan Yuanming in Hangzhou are Zhang Shicheng's arms and fingers. If Pingjiang is besieged, they will come to its aid with all their strength, making it difficult to achieve victory. It is better to attack Huzhou first, exhausting them. With their wings clipped, Pingjiang will be isolated and easily captured." On the jiaxu day, they defeated Zhang Tianqi at Huzhou. Zhang Shicheng personally led troops to aid but was defeated at Zaolin. In September, on the yiwei day, Li Wenzhong attacked Hangzhou. In October of winter, on the renzi day, Chang Yuchun defeated Zhang Shicheng's troops at Wuzhen. In November, on the jiashen day, Zhang Tianqi surrendered. On the xinmao day, Li Wenzhong captured Yuhang, and Pan Yuanming surrendered, followed by the surrounding counties. On the guimao day, they besieged Pingjiang. In December, Han Lin'er died. The following year was designated the first year of Wu, and they established temples, palaces, and altars, offering sacrifices to mountains and rivers. The authorities presented palace designs, and Taizu ordered the removal of ornate carvings. That year, Kuo Kuo Temur and Li Siqi, and Zhang Liangbi of the Yuan dynasty had a falling out, frequently clashing, and the imperial orders were not followed, causing increased suffering for the people in the Central Plains.

Paragraph 21:
二十七年春正月戊戌，諭中書省曰：「東南久罹兵革，民生凋敝，吾甚憫之。且太平、應天諸郡，吾渡江開創地，供億煩勞久矣。今比戶空虛，有司急催科，重困吾民，將何以堪。其賜太平田租二年，應天、鎮江、寧國、廣德各一年。」二月丁未，傅友德敗擴廓將李二於徐州，執之。三月丁丑，始設文武科取士。夏四月，方國珍陰遣人通擴廓及陳友定，移書責之。五月己亥，初置翰林院。是月，以旱減膳素食，復徐、宿、濠、泗、壽、邳、東海、安東、襄陽、安陸及新附地田租三年。六月戊辰，大雨，群臣請復膳。太祖曰：「雖雨，傷禾已多，其賜民今年田租。」癸酉，命朝賀罷女樂。秋七月丙子，給府州縣官之任費，賜綺帛，及其父母妻長子有差，著為令。己丑，雷震宮門獸吻，赦罪囚。庚寅，遣使責方國珍貢糧。八月癸丑，圜丘、方丘、社稷壇成。九月甲戌，太廟成。硃亮祖帥師討國珍。戊寅，詔曰：「先王之政，罪不及孥。自今除大逆不道，毋連坐。」辛巳，徐達克平江，執士誠，吳地平。戊戌，遣使致書於元主，送其宗室神保大王等北還。辛丑，論平吳功，封李善長宣國公，徐達信國公，常遇春鄂國公，將士賜賚有差。硃亮祖克台州。癸卯，新宮成。
In the twenty-seventh year, in the first month of spring, on the wuxu day, Taizu instructed the Central Secretariat, "The southeast has long suffered from warfare, and the people's livelihood has greatly deteriorated. I am deeply sympathetic. Moreover, Taiping, Yingtian, and other counties, where we first crossed the river to establish our foundation, have been burdened with supplying resources for a long time. Now, the households are empty, and the officials' urgent tax collection further burdens the people. How can they endure this? Exempt the land taxes of Taiping for two years, and Yingtian, Zhenjiang, Ningguo, and Guangde for one year each." In February, on the dingwei day, Fu Youde defeated Kuo Kuo Temur's general Li Er at Xuzhou and captured him. In March, on the dingchou day, the first civil and military examinations were established to select scholars. In April of summer, Fang Guozhen secretly sent emissaries to communicate with Kuo Kuo Temur and Chen Youding, reproaching them in a letter. In May, on the jihai day, the Hanlin Academy was established. That month, due to drought, Taizu reduced the number of dishes and adopted a frugal diet, and he exempted the land taxes of Xuzhou, Suzhou, Haozhou, Sizhou, Shouzhou, Pixian, Donghai, Andong, Xiangyang, and Anlu, and newly incorporated areas for three years. In June, on the wuchen day, heavy rain fell, and the ministers requested to resume the usual meals. Taizu said, "Although it has rained, much of the crops have already been damaged. Exempt the people's land taxes for this year." On the guiyou day, he ordered the suspension of female entertainers at court ceremonies. In July of autumn, on the bingzi day, he provided funds for the officials of the prefectures and counties, granting silk, and making provisions for their parents, wives, and eldest sons according to rank, establishing this as a regulation. On the jicou day, a thunderstorm struck the palace gates, pardoning prisoners. On the gengyin day, he sent envoys to demand grain tribute from Fang Guozhen. In August, on the guichou day, the round altar, square altar, and the altar of soil and grain were completed. In September, on the jiaxu day, the Grand Ancestral Temple was completed. Zhu Liangzu led troops to attack Fang Guozhen. On the wuyin day, an edict declared, "The laws of the ancient kings did not implicate family members in the crimes of individuals. Henceforth, except for great treason and unpardonable crimes, there will be no collective punishment." On the xinsi day, Xu Da captured Pingjiang, capturing Zhang Shicheng, and pacifying the Wu territory. On the wuwu day, envoys were sent to the Yuan Emperor, returning members of the imperial family, such as Prince Shenbao, to the north. On the xinchou day, the merits of pacifying Wu were discussed, and Li Shanchang was granted the title of Duke of Xuan, Xu Da was granted the title of Duke of Xin, Chang Yuchun was granted the title of Duke of E, and the soldiers were rewarded accordingly. Zhu Liangzu captured Taizhou. On the guimao day, the new palace was completed.

Paragraph 22:
冬十月甲辰，遣起居注吳琳、魏觀以幣求遺賢於四方。丙午，令百官禮儀尚左。改李善長左相國，徐達右相國。辛亥，祀元臣余闕於安慶，李黼於江州。壬子，置御史台。癸丑，湯和為征南將軍，吳禎副之，討國珍。甲寅，定律令。戊午，正郊社、太廟雅樂。
In the tenth month of winter, on the jiachen day, Taizu sent the recorder of daily events, Wu Lin, and Wei Guan, with gifts to seek out worthy and talented individuals from all directions. On the bingwu day, he decreed that all officials should prioritize etiquette and ceremony. He reassigned Li Shanchang as the Left Prime Minister and Xu Da as the Right Prime Minister. On the xinhai day, he offered sacrifices to the former Yuan ministers Yu Que in Anqing and Li Fu in Jiangzhou. On the renzi day, he established the Censorate. On the guichou day, he appointed Tang He as the General of the Southern Expedition and Wu Zhen as his deputy to campaign against Fang Guozhen. On the jiayin day, he codified the laws.

Paragraph 23:
庚申，召諸將議北征。太祖曰：「山東則王宣反側，河南則擴廓跋扈，關隴則李思齊、張思道梟張猜忌，元祚將亡，中原塗炭。今將北伐，拯生民於水火，何以決勝？」遇春對曰：「以我百戰之師，敵彼久逸之卒，直搗元都，破竹之勢也。」太祖曰：「元建國百年，守備必固，懸軍深入，饋餉不前，援兵四集，危道也。吾欲先取山東，撤彼屏蔽，移兵兩河，破其籓籬，拔潼關而守之，扼其戶檻。天下形勝入我掌握，然後進兵，元都勢孤援絕，不戰自克。鼓行而西，雲中、九原、關隴可席捲也。」諸將皆曰善。
On the gengshen day, Taizu summoned the generals to discuss a northern campaign. Taizu said, "In Shandong, Wang Xuan is restless; in Henan, Kuo Kuo Temur is overbearing; in Guanzhong, Li Siqi and Zhang Sidao are defiant and suspicious. The Yuan dynasty is nearing its end, and the Central Plains are in turmoil. We must launch a northern campaign to rescue the people from disaster. How can we secure victory?" Chang Yuchun replied, "With our battle-hardened troops against their long-idle soldiers, we can directly strike the Yuan capital with unstoppable momentum." Taizu said, "The Yuan dynasty has been established for a hundred years, and their defenses are surely strong. If we march deep into their territory, supply lines will be cut, and reinforcements will converge from all directions, putting us in a dangerous position. I propose we first capture Shandong, dismantling their outer defenses, then move our troops to the two rivers, breaking their barriers, and seize Tongguan to guard it, controlling the gateway. With strategic points in our grasp, we can advance, isolating the Yuan capital, cutting off their reinforcements, and they will fall without a fight. Then, we can march west and sweep through Yunzhong, Jiuyuan, and Guanzhong." All the generals agreed.
