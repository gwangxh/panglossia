    <h2 id="main-doctrine">I. Main Doctrine—宗本義</h2>
    
    <p>
      <span class="main-text">本無、實相、法性、性空、緣會，一義耳。</span>
      <span class="translation">“Original nonbeing,” “reality-mark,” “Dharma-nature,” “emptiness by nature,” “dependent origination”: all these are one doctrine.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <span class="main-text">何則？一切諸法，緣會而生。緣會而生，則未生無有，緣離則滅。如其真有，有則無滅。以此而推，故知雖今現有，有而性常自空。性常自空，故謂之性空。性空故，故曰法性。法性如是，故曰實相。實相自無，非推之使無，故名本無。</span>
      <span class="translation">How so? All dharmas arise through dependent origination: before they arise, they do not exist; when the conditions of their existence perish, they too cease to exist. Were they to exist substantially, then—once in existence—it would be impossible for them to perish. From this it follows that though they presently manifest as being, in nature they are always fundamentally empty. This is referred to as “emptiness by nature.” This empty nature is called “Dharma-nature.” Dharma-nature being thus, it is called “reality-mark.” Reality-mark is a nonbeing by itself—it is not made a nonbeing merely through analysis. Thus it is called “original nonbeing.”</span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <span class="main-text">言不有不無者，不如有見常見之有，邪見斷見之無耳。若以有為有，則以無為無。夫不存無以觀法者，可謂識法實相矣。雖觀有而無所取相，然則法相為無相之相，聖人之心為住無所住矣。</span>
      <span class="translation">Negations of being and nonbeing are not expressions of a belief in a substantial, eternal being and in an annihilationist, nihilistic nonbeing. To take being as being leads one to take nonbeing as nonbeing. But to perceive dharmas without attachment to nonbeing is to discern the reality-mark of dharmas: in this manner, though one perceives being, one does so without grasping to marks. Since the dharma-marks thus perceived are markless marks, the mind of the sage is established in that which has no location.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <span class="main-text">三乘，等觀性空而得道也。性空者，謂諸法實相也。見法實相故云正觀，若其異者便為邪觀。設二乘不見此理，則顛倒也。是以三乘觀法無異，但心有大小為差耳。</span>
      <span class="translation">Beings in all three vehicles attain the Dao through insight into emptiness by nature. Emptiness by nature is called the reality-mark of dharmas. To see the reality-mark of dharmas is called correct contemplation; to see differently is called wrong contemplation. Whoever should think that beings of the two vehicles have no insight into this principle would be gravely mistaken. The Dharma perceived by all three is the same, what differs are merely the mental capacities of beings.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <span class="main-text">漚和般若者，大慧之稱也。諸法實相，謂之般若；能不形證，漚和功也。適化眾生，謂之漚和；不染塵累，般若力也。然則般若之門觀空，漚和之門涉有。涉有未始迷虛，故常處有而不染；不厭有而觀空，故觀空而不證。是謂一念之力權慧具矣。一念之力權慧具矣，好思，歷然可解。</span>
      <span class="translation">Upāya and prajñā are called “great wisdom.” To see the reality-mark of dharmas is called prajñā; to then not claim final liberation is the work of upāya (skillful means). To adapt to beings and transform them is called upāya; to not be tainted by karmic afflictions is the power of prajñā. Thus, the gate of prajñā is the contemplation of emptiness, the gate of upāya is immersion in being. In the midst of being vacuity is never lost, therefore one can dwell within being while not becoming polluted by it. Contemplation of emptiness does not reject being; thus while contemplating emptiness one can refrain from claiming final realization. In this way within one moment of thought both skillful means (upāya) and wisdom (prajñā) are fully activated. Reflect on this well, and you will understand fully.</span>

      <span class="main-text">泥洹盡諦者，直結盡而已，則生死永滅，故謂盡耳；無復別有一盡處耳。</span>
      <span class="translation">The truth of nirvana, of cessation: once afflictions are eradicated, life and death are forever extinguished—“cessation” is only this, not some other place to be reached.</span>

    <h2 id="things-do-not-shift">II. Things Do Not Shift—物不遷論第一</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="main-text">夫生死交謝，寒暑迭遷，有物流動。人之常情。余則謂之不然。何者？</span>
      <span class="translation">Life and death alternate, seasons come and go, all things are in flux: this is the common view. I say it is erroneous. Here is why.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="main-text">《放光》云：「法無去來，無動轉者。」尋夫不動之作，豈釋動以求靜？必求靜於諸動。必求靜於諸動，故雖動而常靜；不釋動以求靜，故雖靜而不離動。然則動靜未始異，</span>
      <span class="translation">It is said in the Radiance, “Dharmas neither come nor go, they do not move in any way.”<sup class="note">1</sup> Is their motionless activity to be sought by discarding motion and instead pursuing stillness? No, it is within all movements that stillness is to be sought. Since stillness is to be sought within all movements, though moving, dharmas are constantly still. Since stillness is to be sought without discarding motion, though still, their motion never ceases. Indeed, motion and stillness are in no way distinct.</span>

      <span class="main-text">而惑者不同，緣使真言滯於競辯，宗途屈於好異。</span>
      <span class="translation">This unity eludes doubters, however. As a result, the true teaching becomes mired in disputations, and the road to understanding is distorted by their fixation on distinctions.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="main-text">所以靜躁之極，未易言也。何者？夫談真則逆俗，順俗則違真。違真故迷性而莫返，逆俗故言淡而無味。緣使中人未分於存亡，下士撫掌而弗顧，</span>
      <span class="translation">Truly, this ultimate, wherein stillness and movement are one, is not easy to capture in words. Why? Talk of the ultimate contradicts conventional beliefs, while conformity with the conventional does injustice to the ultimate. Words that oppose the ultimate lose sight of Nature and are powerless to convert beings. Words that disregard the conventional are bland, flavorless: hearing them, people of average faculties cannot tell what is real and what is not, while inferior types clap their hands in amusement and turn away.<sup class="note">2</sup></span>

      <span class="translation">It is said in the Dao Practice, “Originally there is no ‘where’ from which dharmas come; when they go, there is no ‘where’ that they reach.”<sup class="note">3</sup> And in the Middle Way Treatise, “Seeing the place [of departure] we see the going, but the goer does not reach a place.”<sup class="note">4</sup> These passages assert that stillness is to be sought in identity with motion, from which it follows that things do not shift.</span>

      <span class="comment"><sup class="note">4</sup> The commentators Yuankang and Wencai suggest that this refers to the general idea of the “Guan qulai pin” section of T.1564:3c6ff, which speaks of the interdependence and thus “emptiness” of the place from which movement proceeds, of the goer, and of going itself.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="main-text">夫人之所謂動者，以昔物不至今，故曰動而非靜。我之所謂靜者，亦以昔物不至今，故曰靜而非動。</span>
      <span class="translation">Now, that past things do not reach the present is what is commonly thought of as movement. People say, “things move, they are not still.” But the same fact that past things do not reach the present is what I call stillness. I say, “things are still, not in motion.”</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="main-text">動而非靜，以其不來；靜而非動。以其不去。然則所造未嘗異，所見未嘗同。逆之所謂塞，順之所謂通。苟得其道，復何滯哉！</span>
      <span class="translation">[Others claim that] since things do not come [from the past to the present], they move and are not still. [I claim that] since things do not depart [from the present to the past], they are still and do not move. What we speak of are not two realities but one, though we view it differently. Oppose this reality—you will be bogged down; align yourself with it—you will penetrate its depths. Once you understand, nothing will obstruct you.</span>

      <span class="main-text">傷夫！人情之惑也久矣，目對真而莫覺。既知往物而不來，而謂今物而可往。往物既不來，今物何所往？</span>
      <span class="translation">Alas, for so long people have been trapped in delusion. Even though they are face to face with the ultimate, they do not wake up to it. They know that past things do not come [from the past to the present], yet they insist that present things can pass away [from the present to the past]. But since past things do not come [to the present], how could present things pass away [to the past]?</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="main-text">何則？求向物於向，於向未甞無；責向物於今，於今未甞有。於今未嘗有，以明物不來；於向未甞無，故知物不去。覆而求今，今亦不往。是謂昔物自在昔，不從今以至昔；今物自在今，不從昔以至今。</span>
      <span class="translation">Allow me to explain. For a past thing, do you search in the past? In the past [such a thing] does not not exist. Do you search for it in the present? In the present it does not exist. That past things do not exist in the present shows that they do not come [to it from the past]; that they do not not exist in the past shows that they do not depart [from it to the present]. Now, as for present things: when in the present, they do not pass away. Hence, past things are by nature in the past—they do not do not reach it from the present; and present things are by nature in the present—they do not reach it from the past.</span>

Confucius speaks to his disciple Yan Hui about the study of the Dao, “I have taught you all my life and now, as we stand shoulder to shoulder, you have forgotten everything: is this not sad?” Sengzhao departs from the wording and meaning of the original story, clearly influenced by the Guo Xiang commentary on the Zhuangzi, and transforms the passage into a reflection on the topic of time.</span>

      <span class="translation">But wait! The Sage said, “The passage of life is swift, swifter than the gushing torrents.”<sup class="note">9</sup> Thus one might object that through insight into impermanence do śrāvakas realize the Dao, and on awakening to the state free of conditions do pratyekabuddhas join with the ultimate. If indeed, as you say, the movement of things does not involve real change, how could it be claimed that by responding to change these two groups attain progress on the Dao?</span>
      <span class="comment"><sup class="note">9</sup> Here the term “Sage” is traditionally interpreted as referring either to Confucius from Lunyu 9.17; or by Yuankang, controversially, to the Buddha from the Da banniepan jing (T.374:398c26).</span>

      <span class="translation">Allow me to explain. While things are said to “depart,” this is not to assert that they literally depart but merely to dispel people’s attachment to the idea of permanence. Though they are said to “remain,” this is not to argue that they literally remain but merely to counter people’s clinging to “passing away.” Surely, “departing” does not mean that things actually evanesce, nor does “remaining” mean that they perdure through time.</span>

    <p>
      <span class="main-text">故《成具》云：「菩薩處計常之中，而演非常之教。」《摩訶衍論》云：「諸法不動，無去來處。」</span>

      <span class="translation">Thus, though things may be said to be “constant” they do not remain. Though described as “departing” they do not shift [in time]. As things do not shift, while passing away they are constantly still; as things do not remain, while still they constantly pass away. In stillness things constantly pass away; thus, while passing away they never shift. In passing away things are constantly still; thus, while still, they never stay.</span>

    <p>
      <span class="main-text">然則莊生之所以藏山，仲尼之所以臨川，斯皆感往者之難留，豈曰排今而可往？</span>
      <span class="translation">Zhuangzi speaks of hiding a mountain in a marsh and Confucius stands at the bank of the river [gazing at its gushing torrent]: both reflect on the inability to make passing things stay in the present. Surely they do not mean that things push away the present and pass away [into the past].<sup class="note">12</sup></span>
      <span class="comment"><sup class="note">12</sup> An allusion to an allegory from Zhuangzi 6.2. To keep his boat safe from thieves a man hides it in a gully inside a mountain, which in turn is hidden in the middle of marshland. A strong man sneaks up in the middle of the night, heaves the boat onto his back, and carries it off. Traditionally this has been read as expressing the vanity of our efforts to counter the transience of things. (Zhuangzi’s final injunction is to “hide the world in the world, so that nothing can be lost.”) The second image, of Confucius standing on the bank of the river, comes from Lunyu 9.17: “Standing by a river, Confucius sighed and said, ‘The passing away of things is like this. Day and night it never stops.’” Both images are used here as exemplifications of impermanence or, in the language of the essay, of the “shifting” of things.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="main-text">是以觀聖人心者，不同人之所見，得也。何者？人則謂少壯同體、百齡一質，徒知年往，不覺形隨。是以梵志出家，白首而歸。隣人見之曰：「昔人尚存乎？」梵志曰：「吾猶昔人，非昔人也。」隣人皆愕然，非其言也。所謂有力者負之而趨，昧者不覺。其斯之謂歟！</span>
      <span class="translation">Indeed, if one carefully examines the mind of the sage, one will understand that what the sage perceives differs from what the common person perceives. How so? People claim that, young or old, a human being is of one constant body and its substance perdures throughout a lifetime of a hundred years. They only know that the years pass, but do not realize that the body follows suit. Take the story of the brahmacārin who left the householder’s life [as a young man] and only returned home as a white-haired old man. When his former neighbors saw him, they said, “Could this be our former neighbor?” The brahmacārin said, “I may seem to be my former self but I am certainly not him.” The neighbors were startled. It is just like in the allegory of the strong man [who sneaks up under cover of night] and carries away [the boat] on his shoulders, [while the owner,] fast asleep, knows nothing [of the theft].<sup class="note">13</sup></span>

      <span class="translation">In order to dispel people’s delusions, the Tathāgata uses words appropriate to their individual limitations; he rides the vehicle of the nondual ultimate mind, yet elaborates nonsingular diverse teachings. Words that even though contradictory do not impute incongruity to their object—such are the words of the Sage alone.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="main-text">故談真有不遷之稱，導俗有流動之說。雖復千途異唱，會歸同致矣。</span>
      <span class="translation">Hence, from the perspective of the ultimate, he teaches of “not-shifting”; in order to guide the common people, he speaks of things flowing through time. Even though he charts out a thousandfold paths, they all return to a common destination.</span>

      <span class="main-text">而徵文者聞不遷，則謂昔物不至今；聆流動者，而謂今物可至昔。既曰古今，而欲遷之者，何也？是以言往不必往，古今常存，以其不動；稱去不必去，謂不從今至古，以其不來。不來，故不馳騁於古今；不動，故各性住於一世。</span>
      <span class="translation">Yet, when those who cling to the evidence of texts hear the teaching of “not-shifting” they say that past things do not reach the present, but when they hear of “flow and motion” they say that present things can reach the past. However, once the terms “past” and “present” have been assigned [to their respective moments], why still insist on viewing things as “shifting” [from one to the other]? After all, when it is said that things “pass away,” this is not to affirm that they literally pass away but only that things of the past and present persist constantly [in their respective moments]—they are not in motion. When it is asserted that things “depart,” this is not to claim that things literally depart but only that things do not reach the past from the present—they do not come. They do not come: they do not gallop between the past and the present. They do not move; each thing, by nature, persists in just one[—its own particular—]time.</span>

      <span class="translation">Now, what others call “remaining” I refer to as “departing”; what they call “departing” I speak of as “remaining.” Yet, though “remaining” and “departing” differ in name, in reality they are one. It is not without reason that the classic says, “True words appear nonsensical.”[Note 14] Who would believe them?</span>

      <span class="translation">How so? People search for past things in the present, and conclude that [things] do not remain. I seek for present [things] in the past and determine that they do not depart. If present [things] could reach the past, then the past should contain those present [things]. If past [things] could reach the present, then the present should contain those past [things]. But there are no past [things] in the present, which shows again that [things] do not come. And there are no present [things] in the past, which shows once more that [things] do not depart.</span>

      <span class="translation">This doctrine is deep and subtle—beyond, I fear, the ken of conventional understanding.

      <span class="comment"><sup class="note">18</sup> Historical evidence regarding these theories is scant and their polemical presentation in this text is descriptively unreliable. Traditionally six (or, in some sources, seven) theories were identified. In this text three are brought into focus. The theory of “original nothingness” is associated variously with the exegetes Daoqian (286–374 C.E.) or Dao’an (312 or 314–385 C.E.). Śūnyatā or tathatā is identified with the pre-Buddhist Chinese concept of wu (nothingness) as the primordial origin of all things. The theory of “no-mind” is usually linked with Zhi Mindu (fl. ca. 326 C.E.). It is sometimes thought of as a subjectivist-psychological response to the more objectivistic orientation of “original nothingness.” “Emptiness as form” is usually associated with Zhi Daolin (known also as Zhi Dun; 314–366 C.E.). The name of this theory is an allusion to the formula “form is emptiness, emptiness is form,” representative of much of the Prajñā- pāramitā literature immensely popular in Sengzhao’s period. The meager available evidence suggests that Zhi Dun’s conception of emptiness was largely similar to Sengzhao’s as formulated in this chapter. Sengzhao, however, portrays him as a believer in a world of composite and thus “empty” dharmas on the one hand, and indivisible and thus “non-empty” dharmas on the other, a position he denounces.</span>

      <span class="translation">Why? The doctrine of “no mentation” defines emptiness as a state in which the mind no longer reaches out toward things, even though things themselves do not cease to exist.

      <span class="translation">The theory of “emptiness is form” rests on the claim that since forms are not self-produced, and despite being called forms, they are not forms. But the analysis of forms should not be limited to forms produced by a coming together of forms; the analysis should apply to forms as such, and should see them as what they are in themselves.

      <span class="translation">The teaching of “original nonbeing” is obsessed with the idea of nonbeing, which dominates the discussion throughout. It takes negations of being as assertions that being is actually nonexistent, and negations of nonbeing as claims that nonbeing likewise is actually nonexistent. However, if one were to investigate the original purport of the scriptures, one would understand that negations of being are merely a rejection of substantialized being, while negations of nonbeing are merely a refutation of substantialized nonbeing. Why insist that negations of being mean that this being is actually nonexistent, and that negations of nonbeing mean that nonbeing is likewise actually nonexistent? Such words reveal an infatuation with “nonbeing”; surely they cannot harmoniously enter the reality of events nor reach the true character of things.</span>

      <span class="translation">Now, on close examination, these assertions of “neither being nor non-being” cannot mean that ultimate truth is realized only when one has purged the mind of all things, shut the doors of seeing and hearing, and when the mind is still and empty. Indeed, ultimate truth is realized when one identifies with things and penetrates them harmoniously, for then things in their concrete reality do not oppose it; and when this very reality is rendered selfsame with the ultimate, for then empty Nature does alter their individual reality. Since Nature does not alter their reality, even though they are nonexistent, things do exist. Since things do not oppose [ultimate truth], even though they are existent, they do not exist. While nonexistent, things exist; hence “existence” does not capture them. While existent, they do not exist, hence “nonexistence” also does not apply. Thus, it is not that nothing exists; rather, things are not substantially real things.

      <span class="translation">This is why the Complete Realization desribes the arbitrariness of names<sup class="note">32</sup> and why the master from Yuanlin Grove<sup class="note">33</sup> uses the metaphors of the finger and the horse. Such profound teachings are everywhere to be found.</span>
      <span class="comment"><sup class="note">32</sup> Likely a reference to T.630:454c2.</span>
      <span class="comment"><sup class="note">33</sup> [Note 33] The “master from Yuanlin Grove” is a reference to Zhuangzi. The “metaphors of

      <span class="main-text">是以聖人乘千化而不變，履萬惑而常通者，以其即萬物之自虛，不假虛而虛物也。</span>
      <span class="translation">Thus again: the Sage rides the vehicle of the thousand transformations yet remains unchanged; he treads amid the myriad objects of delusion yet always penetrates them. This is because he has identified with the self-emptiness of things, instead of imputing vacuity to things through conventional concepts.</span>

      <span class="main-text">故經云：「甚奇，世尊！不動真際為諸法立處。」非離真而立處，立處即真也。</span>
      <span class="translation">Thus it is said in the sutra, “How marvelous, World-honored One! Unmoved in the apex of reality, you establish all dharmas.”[Note 34] Dharmas are not established outside of the ultimate, they are established as one with the ultimate.</span>

      <span class="main-text">然則道遠乎哉？觸事而真！聖遠乎哉？體之即神！</span>
      <span class="translation">Is the Dao beyond reach? Touch phenomena—they are the ultimate. Is sagacity beyond reach? Realize them—you will be a like a spirit.</span>
