  <h1>The Sutra of Forty-two Sections (四十二章經)</h1>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">昔漢孝明皇帝夜夢見神人，身體有金色，項有日光，飛在殿前，意中欣然，甚悅之。明日問群臣：「此為何神也？」</span>
    <span class="translation">In ancient times Emperor Xiaoming of the Later Han had a dream one night in which he saw a heavenly being with a golden body and a bright halo on its head fly into the palace. He was greatly delighted by this. The following day, the emperor asked his ministers, “Which heavenly being was that?”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">有通人傅毅曰：「臣聞天竺有得道者，號曰佛，輕舉能飛，殆將其神也。」</span>
    <span class="translation">Fuyi, a man of vast learning and experience, said, “I have heard that in India there was a person who had attained the Way, called ‘Buddha,' who could fly easily. The heavenly being must be him.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">於是上悟，即遣使者張騫、羽林中郎將秦景博士弟子王遵等十二人，至大月支國寫取佛經四十二章。在第十四石函中登起立塔寺，於是道法流布，處處修立佛寺。遠人伏化願為臣妾者，不可稱數，國內清寧，含識之類蒙恩受賴于今不絕也。</span>
    <span class="translation">Being thus informed, the emperor immediately dispatched to the country of the Yuezhi a group of twelve, including the envoy Zhangjian, the Lieutenant General of the Palace Guards Qinjing, and Wangzun, a student of the scholars of the National University, and others. [They] copied and brought back the Sutra of Forty-two Sections and kept it in the fourteenth stone [book storage] chamber, where a stupa was built. Thereafter, the Buddhist teachings spread widely and monasteries were built everywhere. The number of people from afar who accepted the Buddhist teachings and willingly became subjects [of the Han] was immeasurable. The whole country enjoyed peace and all sentient beings have received unceasing benefits from the teachings.</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「辭親出家為道，名曰沙門，常行二百五十戒，為四真道行，進志清淨，成阿羅漢。阿羅漢者，能飛行變化，住壽命，動天地；次為阿那含，阿那含者，壽終魂靈上十九天，於彼得阿羅漢；次為斯陀含，斯陀含者，一上一還，即得阿羅漢；次為須陀洹，須陀洹者，七死七生，便得阿羅漢；愛欲斷者，譬如四支斷，不復用之。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “One who takes leave of one's family and renounces household life in order to follow the Way is called a śramaṇa. Such a person constantly observes the two hundred and fifty precepts. By practicing the Four Noble Truths and progressively aspiring after purity, one becomes an arhat (“worthy one”). Arhats can fly, transform themselves, live long lives, and move about everywhere in heaven and earth. “Prior to that, one is a non-returner (anāgāmin). At the end of that life, the spirit of the non-returner ascends to the nineteenth heaven where one becomes an arhat. “Prior to that, one is a once-returner (sakṛdāgāmin) who, after once more ascending [to heaven] and returning [to earth], becomes an arhat. “Prior to that, one is a stream-enterer (srota-āpanna) who realizes arhatship after seven more rounds of birth and death. “Cutting off desire is like cutting off one's four limbs—they won't be used again.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「除鬚髮，為沙門，受道法，去世資財，乞求取足，日中一食，樹下一宿，慎不再矣！使人愚弊者，愛與欲也。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “He who has shaved his beard and head to become a śramaṇa and has accepted the Buddhist teachings gives up worldly belongings. Satisfied with almsfood, he takes only one meal a day at noon and passes the night beneath the same tree only once, careful to curb his desires. What makes men foolish and wicked are craving and desire.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「眾生以十事為善，亦以十事為惡。身三、口四、意三。身三者：殺、盜、婬；口四者：兩舌、惡罵、妄言、綺語；意三者：嫉、恚、癡，不信三尊，以邪為真。優婆塞行五事，不懈退，至十事，必得道也。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “There are ten virtuous actions and there are also ten non-virtuous actions. Three are performed with the body, four with speech, and three with mind. The three [non-virtues] performed with the body are killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct; the four [non-virtues] of speech are deceit, slander, lying, and idle talk; the three [non-virtues] of mind refer to jealousy, malice, and ignorance. Those who do not believe in the Three Jewels take evil as truth. If a layperson practices the five precepts without indolence, and then proceeds to perform the ten precepts, the Way will certainly be attained.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「人有眾過，而不自悔，頓止其心，罪來歸身，猶水歸海，自成深廣矣；有惡知非，改過得善，罪日消滅，後會得道也。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “If a person commits all kinds of offenses and does not regret them but puts them out of mind, the offenses become overwhelming, just as the sea broadens and deepens when water flows into it. On the other hand, if a person with faults becomes aware of them and changes for the better, negative consequences are eliminated day by day, and eventually the Way is attained.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「人愚吾以為不善，吾以四等慈護濟之；重以惡來者，吾重以善往，福德之氣，常在此也；害氣重殃，反在于彼。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “When someone confronts me with ill intention, I protect and benefit him with the four virtues [of loving-kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity]. Whenever non-virtues are perpetrated toward me, I repeatedly return them with goodness. Virtuous merits are always on my side, while harmful calamities befall the other.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">有人聞佛道守大仁慈，以惡來，以善往，故來罵。佛默然不答，愍之癡冥狂愚使然。罵止，問曰：「子以禮從人，其人不納，實禮如之乎？」曰：「持歸。」「今子罵我，我亦不納，子自持歸，禍子身矣！猶響應聲，影之追形，終無免離，慎為惡也。」</span>
    <span class="translation">A person heard the Buddha teach that one should uphold great compassion and return good for evil. He purposefully came to reproach the Buddha. The Buddha remained silent without retort and felt pity for the man, for his foolishness and ignorance caused him to act that way. When the man ended his reproach, the Buddha asked him, “If you present a gift to someone but he does not accept it, what do you do?” “I take it back.” “Now you have given me a reproach but I do not accept it. So you will take it back upon yourself, and the harm is your own. It is like an echo following a sound or a shadow following an object—you cannot keep it away. Therefore, take care not to commit non-virtue.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「惡人害賢者，猶仰天而唾，唾不污天，還污己身；逆風坋人，塵不污彼，還坋于身。賢者不可毀，禍必滅己也。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “An evil man who tries to harm a virtuous one is like one who raises his head and spits toward heaven; the spittle does not stain heaven but returns to stain the spitter. When one throws dust against the wind toward another, the dust does not soil the other but returns to soil oneself. The virtuous cannot be harmed, while the evil inevitably destroy themselves.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「夫人為道務博愛，博哀施德莫大施。守志奉道，其福甚大；覩人施道，助之歡喜，亦得福報。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “Anyone who follows the Way should have nondiscriminating love and compassion—to practice virtue is the greatest practice. The blessings of maintaining one's aspirations on the Way are great. When you see someone practice the Way and help him joyously, you will also obtain blessings.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">質曰：「彼福不當減乎？」</span>
    <span class="translation">A person asked, “Would the blessings not run out?”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「猶若炬火，數千百人，各以炬來，取其火去，熟食、除冥；彼火如故，福亦如之。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “It is like the fire of a torch, to which thousands of people can come to light their own torches. They can thus depart to cook food and eliminate darkness for themselves, while the light [of the original torch] remains the same. Blessings are also like that.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「飯凡人百不如飯一善人，飯善人千不如飯持五戒者一人，飯持五戒者萬人不如飯一須陀洹，飯須陀洹百萬不如飯一斯陀含，飯斯陀含千萬不如飯一阿那含，飯阿那含一億不如飯一阿羅漢，飯阿羅漢十億不如飯辟支佛一人，飯辟支佛百億不如以三尊之教度其一世二親，教親千億不如飯一佛——學願求佛，欲濟眾生也。飯善人福最深重，凡人事天地鬼神，不如孝其親矣，二親最神也。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “Bestowing almsfood on one hundred ordinary people is not as worthwhile as bestowing almsfood on one virtuous one. “Bestowing almsfood on one thousand virtuous people is not as worthwhile as bestowing almsfood on one observer of the five precepts. “Bestowing almsfood on ten thousand observers of the five precepts is not as worthwhile as bestowing almsfood on one stream-enterer. “Bestowing almsfood on one million stream-enterers is not as worthwhile as bestowing almsfood on one once-returner. “Bestowing almsfood on ten million once-returners is not as worthwhile as bestowing almsfood on one non-returner. “Bestowing almsfood on one hundred million non-returners is not as worthwhile as bestowing almsfood on one arhat. “Bestowing almsfood on one billion arhats is not as worthwhile as bestowing almsfood on one pratyekabuddha (solitary enlightened one). “Bestowing almsfood on ten billion pratyekabuddhas is not as worthwhile as converting one's parents in this life to the teachings of the Three Jewels. “Converting parents as many as one hundred billion is not as worthwhile as bestowing almsfood on a person who seeks buddhahood and helps other sentient beings (i.e., a bodhisattva). “The blessings obtained from bestowing almsfood on virtuous people are the greatest. To worship heaven, earth, spirits, and gods is not as worthwhile as being filial to one's own parents, for parents are most divine.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「天下有五難：貧窮布施難、豪貴學道難、制命不死難、得覩佛經難、生值佛世難。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “There are five things in this world that are difficult to do: “It is difficult to practice giving when one is poor. “It is difficult to train in the Way when one has wealth and power. “It is difficult to achieve immortality. “It is difficult to have the opportunity to read Buddhist sutras. “It is difficult to be born during the time of a buddha.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">有沙門問佛：「以何緣得道？奈何知宿命？」</span>
    <span class="translation">A śramaṇa asked the Buddha, “What conditions are necessary to attain the Way? How does one gain knowledge of one's previous lives?”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「道無形，知之無益，要當守志行；譬如磨鏡，垢去明存，即自見形，斷欲守空，即見道真，知宿命矣。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha replied, “The Way is without form and to know it is of no avail. One must maintain the aspiration to practice. It is like polishing a mirror. When the tarnish is gone, the mirror shines, and one sees one's own form. [Similarly,] when one severs desires and maintains [their] emptiness, one sees the truth of the Way and knows all previous existences.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「何者為善？唯行道善。何者最大？志與道合大。何者多力？忍辱最健，忍者無怨，必為人尊。何者最明？心垢除、惡行滅，內清淨無瑕；未有天地，逮于今日，十方所有，未見之萌，得無不知、無不見、無不聞，得一切智，可謂明乎。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “What is virtue? To follow the Way is virtue. What is greatness? When one's aspirations conform to the Way, that is greatness. What is great power? Patience and forbearance constitute great power. One who is patient harbors no grudge and is certain to be honored by all. What is the pinnacle of brilliance? This is when the impurities of the mind are eliminated, negative actions eradicated, and one inwardly becomes pure, without stain. When there is nothing in the ten directions, from before the formation of heaven and earth up until now, that is not seen, known, or heard, and when all knowing is obtained, that is called the pinnacle of brilliance.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「人懷愛欲不見道，譬如濁水，以五彩投其中，致力攪之，眾人共臨水上，無能覩其影者；愛欲交錯，心中為濁，故不見道；水澄穢除，清淨無垢，即自見形。猛火著釜下，中水踊躍，以布覆上，眾生照臨，亦無覩其影者；心中本有三毒涌沸在內，五蓋覆外，終不見道；要心垢盡，乃知魂靈所從來，生死所趣向，諸佛國土、道德所在耳。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “Those who cherish desires do not perceive the Way. Just as people cannot perceive their reflections in water that has been polluted by the [objects of] five colors and stirred vigorously, so the Way cannot be perceived by those whose minds are polluted by interwoven love and desire. However, when the water is allowed to settle and the filth is removed, so that the water becomes clean and pure, one sees one's form. If someone looks down at a cloth-covered kettle boiling over a raging fire, no reflection can be seen. [Similarly,] those who are boiling internally with the three poisons (greed, anger, and ignorance) and externally covered by the five hindrances will never perceive the Way. Only after the mire of the mind is cleared away will one come to know the source of consciousness, where birth and death lead to, and where the buddha lands are and what morality is.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「夫為道者，譬如持炬火入冥室中，其冥即滅而明猶在，學道見諦，愚癡都滅，得無不見。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “A person who follows the Way is like one who enters a dark room with a torch. The darkness is immediately dispelled and only light remains. [Similarly,] by studying the Way and perceiving the truth, a person dispels ignorance and nothing is unknowable.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「吾何念念道？吾何行行道？吾何言言道？吾念諦道，不忽須臾也。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “My awareness is awareness of the Way, my practice is practice of the Way, and my speech is speech of the Way. I am continually aware of the truth of the Way without even a single moment's lapse.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「覩天地念非常，覩山川念非常，覩万物形體豐熾念非常；執心如此，得道疾矣。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “Be mindful of impermanence upon seeing heaven and earth. Be mindful of impermanence upon seeing rivers and mountains. Be mindful of impermanence upon seeing the abundant forms of myriad things. Being thus mindful, you can quickly attain the Way.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「一日行，常念道、行道，遂得信根，其福無量。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “If in daily activity, one constantly remembers and practices the Way, the root of faith will be attained. Its blessings are immeasurable.”</span>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「熟自念身中四大，名自有名都為無，吾我者寄生，生亦不久，其事如幻耳。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “Be aware that though the four physical elements all have their own names, even they do not exist. The self is only conventionally existent, and such existence is not permanent. All things are like a mirage.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「人隨情欲求華名，譬如燒香，眾人聞其香，然香以熏自燒；愚者貪流俗之名譽，不守道真，華名危己之禍，其悔在後時。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “Complying with their desires, people seek fame. It is like burning incense. Many people can smell its fragrance but the incense itself is consumed. Foolish beings crave worldly fame without adhering to the truth of the Way. Calamity attends such worldly fame, causing later regret.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「財色之於人，譬如小兒貪刀刃之蜜，甜不足一食之美，然有截舌之患也。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “For men, wealth and lust are like a child's attraction to honey on the blade of a knife. There is not even a meal's worth, yet there is danger that the child will cut his tongue.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「人繫於妻子、寶宅之患，甚於牢獄、桎梏、鋃鐺。牢獄有原赦，妻子情欲雖有虎口之禍，己猶甘心投焉，其罪無赦。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “The misfortune of attachment to wife, children, possessions, and home is worse than that of being shackled and chained in prison. A prisoner may someday be pardoned but the longings for wife and children are as dangerous as the jaws of a tiger, and the fault of succumbing to them is unpardonable.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「愛欲莫甚於色，色之為欲，其大無外。賴有一矣，假其二，普天之民，無能為道者。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “Of all desires, there is none worse than lust. Of desires, lust has no equal. Fortunately, it is one of a kind. If there were another desire so strong, no one in the world could follow the Way.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「愛欲之於人，猶執炬火逆風而行。愚者不釋炬，必有燒手之患。貪婬、恚怒、愚癡之毒，處在人身，不早以道除斯禍者，必有危殃，猶愚貪執炬，自燒其手也。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “People with strong desires are like those who walk against the wind carrying a torch. If they are foolish enough not to let go of the torch, their hands will inevitably be burned. The poisons of lust, anger, hatred, and ignorance are within human beings and, if not quickly eradicated with the help of the Way, will certainly cause harm. It is just like the fool who holds onto a torch even as his hand is being burned.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">天神獻玉女於佛，欲以試佛意、觀佛道。佛言：「革囊眾穢，爾來何為？以可斯俗，難動六通。去！吾不用爾。」天神踰敬佛，因問道意；佛為解釋，即得須陀洹。</span>
    <span class="translation">A heavenly being (deva) offered the Buddha a beautiful girl in order to test the Buddha's will and to observe his Way. The Buddha said, “O skinbag, full of all kinds of filth! What have you come here for? You may be able to deceive the world but you cannot move one who has gained the six supernatural powers. Go away. I don't need you.” The heavenly being paid profound reverence to the Buddha and asked him the meaning of the Way. As soon as the Buddha explained it to him he immediately became a stream-enterer.</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「夫為道者，猶木在水，尋流而行，不左觸岸，亦不右觸岸；不為人所取，不為鬼神所遮，不為洄流所住，亦不腐敗，吾保其入海矣。人為道，不為情欲所惑，不為眾邪所誑，精進無疑，吾保其得道矣。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “One who follows the Way is like a piece of wood floating down a river. If it does not touch the left or the right bank, is neither picked up by someone nor intercepted by the gods, is neither caught in whirlpools nor rots on the way, I guarantee it will reach the sea. If one follows the Way without being confused by lust or deceived by all kinds of depravity, but instead earnestly advances forward without doubts, I guarantee that he will attain his goal.”</span>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛告沙門：「慎無信汝意，意終不可信。慎無與色會，與色會即禍生。得阿羅漢道，乃可信汝意耳。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said to the śramaṇas, “Be careful not to trust your thoughts, for they are not trustworthy. Be careful not to come into contact with physical attractions, for contact with them brings calamity. Only when you have realized arhatship can you trust your own thoughts.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛告諸沙門：「慎無視女人，若見無視。慎無與言，若與言者，勅心正行，曰：『吾為沙門，處于濁世，當如蓮花不為泥所污。老者以為母，長者以為姊，少者為妹，幼者子，敬之以禮。』意殊當諦惟觀，自頭至足自視內，彼身何有，唯盛惡露諸不淨種，以釋其意矣。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said to the śramaṇas, “Be careful not to look at women. If you happen to see them, do not look at them. Be careful not to talk with women, but if you should happen to talk to them, control your thoughts and behave properly, thinking ‘I am a śramaṇa living in this impure world. I should be like the lotus flower that is not defiled by mud. I should treat elderly women as my own mother, those older than myself as my older sisters, those younger than myself as my younger sisters, and the young ones as my daughters.' You should respect them politely but reflect in your minds that their bodies, from head to foot, contain nothing but all sorts of filth and impurities. Thus, you can be rid of desire.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「人為道去情欲，當如草見火，火來已却。道人見愛欲，必當遠之。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “Those who follow the Way should eradicate lust. It is like straw that must be kept from an oncoming fire. A follower of the Way should look upon desire as something that must be kept at a distance.”</span>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「人有患婬，情不止，踞斧刃上，以自除其陰。佛謂之曰：『若斷陰不如斷心，心為功曹，若止功曹，從者都息；邪心不止，斷陰何益？斯須即死？』」佛言：「世俗倒見，如斯癡人。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “There was a man who was continually plagued by sexual desire and wished to castrate himself with a knife. I said to him, ‘To cut off your sex organ would not be as good as to cut off your thoughts, for thoughts are like the officer in charge. If the officer in charge is stopped, the followers will also be stopped. If a deviant thought persists, what is the use of severing the sex organ except to cause imminent death?' I teach that people who hold perverted worldly views are just like that foolish man.”</span>

If I do not allow such thoughts to arise, Thus you will not arise. Passing by, the Buddha heard this verse and told the śramaṇas, “Remember! This verse was spoken by Kāśyapa Buddha and it is still circulating in the world.”</span>

    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “Following the Way is like fighting alone against [an army of] ten thousand. While putting on armor and preparing to fight, one may become frightened and run away. Halfway to the battlefield, one may turn and flee. One may fight and be slain. One may gain victory and return to his country with honor. If a person maintains firm resolve and advances vigorously, not misled by vulgar and foolish words but instead destroying desire and negativity completely, the Way will certainly be attained.”</span>

    <span class="main-text">有沙門夜誦經甚悲，意有悔疑，欲生思歸。佛呼沙門問之：「汝處于家將何修為？」</span>
    <span class="translation">One night, a śramaṇa was reciting a sutra. He sounded very mournful, for he thought regretfully of retrogressing [to lay life]. The Buddha called to the śramaṇa and asked him, “When you were a householder, what did you do?”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">對曰：「恒彈琴。」佛言：「絃緩何如？」曰：「不鳴矣。」「絃急何如？」曰：「聲絕矣。」「急緩得中何如？」「諸音普悲。」佛告沙門：「學道猶然，執心調適，道可得矣。」</span>
    <span class="translation">“I used to play the lute,” he replied. The Buddha said, “What happened when the strings were too slack?” “They would not make a sound,” was the reply. “What happened if the strings were too taut?” asked the Buddha. “The sounds were sharp,” he answered. “And how was it when the strings were neither too taut nor too slack?” “The sounds were fine.” The Buddha said to the śramaṇa, “It is the same with training in the Way. When the mind is properly adjusted, the Way is attained.”</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「夫人為道，猶所鍛鐵漸深，棄去垢，成器必好。學道以漸深，去心垢，精進就道。暴即身疲，身疲即意惱，意惱即行退，行退即修罪。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “Following the Way is like smelting iron. If iron is melted gradually to eliminate all impurities, it can be made into implements of fine quality. One who trains in the Way should also progress gradually to expel the defilements of the mind, while maintaining proper effort. If you force yourself abruptly on the Way, the body grows weary. When the body grows weary, your thoughts become disturbed. When thoughts become disturbed, your practice deteriorates. And when practice deteriorates, you accumulate non-virtue.”</span>

    <span class="main-text">佛言：「人為道亦苦，不為道亦苦。惟人自生至老，自老至病，自病至死，其苦無量。心惱積罪，生死不息，其苦難說。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “Beings experience suffering whether or not they follow the Way. From birth to old age, old age to sickness, sickness to death, suffering is endless. With turbulent thoughts, beings accumulate non-virtues and, consequently, birth and death continue ceaselessly with their unutterable suffering.”</span>

    <span class="main-text">佛言：「夫人離三惡道得為人難；既得為人，去女即男難；既得為男，六情完具難；六情已具，生中國難；既處中國，值奉佛道難；既奉佛道，值有道之君難，生菩薩家難；既生菩薩家，以心信三尊、值佛世難。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “It is difficult for one to leave the three unfortunate transmigrations (i.e., rebirth in the three lower realms of hell, hungry ghosts, and animals) and to be born as a human being. “Even if born as a human being, it is difficult for one to be born a man rather than a woman. “Even if born as a man it is difficult to be born with all six sense organs intact. “Even if born with the six sense organs intact, it is difficult to be born in a central country [where the Buddhist teachings flourish]. “Even if born in a central country, it is difficult to encounter and practice the Buddhist teachings. “Even if one encounters and practices the Buddhist teachings, it is difficult to encounter a sagacious king. [“Even if one encounters a sagacious king,] it is difficult to be born in the household of a bodhisattva. “Even if born into the household of a bodhisattva, it is difficult to have faith in the Three Jewels and to live at the time of a buddha.”</span>

    <span class="main-text">佛問諸沙門：「人命在幾間？」對曰：「在數日間。」佛言：「子未能為道。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha asked the śramaṇas, “How long is the lifespan of a human being?” “It is but a few days,” was the reply. “You still have not understood the Way,” the Buddha replied.</span>

    <span class="main-text">復問一沙門：「人命在幾間？」對曰：「在飯食間。」佛言：「子未能為道。」</span>
    <span class="translation">He asked another, “How long is the lifespan of a human being?” “It is the time required for a single meal,” was the reply. The Buddha said, “You have not yet understood the Way.”</span>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">復問一沙門：「人命在幾間？」對曰：「呼吸之間。」佛言：「善哉！子可謂為道者矣。」</span>
    <span class="translation">Again, he asked another, “How long is the lifespan of a human being?” “It is the time taken to inhale and exhale a single breath,” was the answer. The Buddha said, “Excellent! You are a follower of the Way.”</span>

    <span class="main-text">佛言：「弟子去，離吾數千里，意念吾戒必得道。在吾左側，意在邪，終不得道。其實在行，近而不行，何益萬分耶！」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “My disciples may be thousands of miles away from me, but if they are mindful of my precepts they will definitely attain the Way. But if those who are in close contact with me have non-virtuous thoughts, they will never attain the Way. The important thing is to practice. How can there be the slightest benefit from staying close to me if one does not practice?”</span>

    <span class="main-text">佛言：「人為道，猶若食蜜，中邊皆甜。吾經亦爾，其義皆快，行者得道矣。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “Following the Way is like tasting honey—it is sweet both within and on the surface. So are my teachings, the meaning of which is fine-edged. Those who practice them will attain the Way.”</span>

    <span class="main-text">佛言：「人為道，能拔愛欲之根，譬如摘懸珠，一一摘之，會有盡時。惡盡，得道也。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “Those who follow the Way can extirpate desires. Just as pearls can be removed from a string one by one until there are none left, one attains the Way when defilements have been eradicated.”</span>

  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛言：「諸沙門行道，當如牛負，行深泥中，疲極，不敢左右顧，趣欲離泥，以自蘇息。沙門視情欲，甚於彼泥，直心念道可免眾苦。」</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha said, “Śramaṇas practicing the Way should be like oxen carrying heavy loads through deep mud. Despite their extreme fatigue, they dare not glance to the left or right. They are eager to emerge from the mud in order to get some rest. Śramaṇas should regard desire as worse than the mud and be wholeheartedly mindful of the Way; thus will they be freed from suffering.”</span>
