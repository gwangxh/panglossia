Moreover, he knows how many kalpas ago these buddhas lived, their given names and surnames, the class and clans into which they were born, what they ate and drank, how long they lived, and the suffering and joy they experienced. Further, he knows: such was the morality of these buddhas, such was their Dharma, such their wisdom, such their understanding, in such a way did they dwell. How [does he know all this]?

In your discussion this is exactly how it should be. A Thus-Come-One has divine powers, and his authority is vast. I know entirely events from countless kalpas in the past.

He replied, “A śramaṇa is one who abandons tenderness and love, leaving his home to cultivate the path. Mastering his sense organs, he is not tainted by eternal desires. Showing kindness for all, he harms nothing. Encountering suffering, he feels no distress; encountering the pleasurable, he takes no delight in it. His tolerance is like that of the earth. This is what is called a śramaṇa." The prince said, “Excellent. This path is true and correct. Cut off forever from the burdens of the world, it is marvelously pure. Only this is happiness.” He then ordered the charioteer to turn the chariot around and approach the śramaṇa.</span>

Modest and serene, he devotes himself only to the path.” The prince said, “Excellent. This path is most true.” Presently, he ordered his charioteer, “Take my precious garments and my chariot. Return and inform the great king. I then will shave off my hair and beard here, don the three religious robes, leave the household and cultivate the path. The reason I do this is because I want to tame my mind, leave behind dust and filth, and be pure and selfreliant in my pursuit of the arts of the path.” Thereupon, the charioteer took the precious chariot that the prince rode and his clothes, and returned to his father, the king. The prince, after this, shaved his hair and beard, donned the three religious robes, left his home and cultivated the path.</span>

    <span class="main-text">佛告比丘：「太子見老、病人，知世苦惱。又見死人，戀世情滅。及見沙門，廓然大悟。下寶車時，步步中間，轉遠縛著。是真出家。是真遠離。時，彼國人聞太子剃除鬚髮。法服持鉢。出家修道。咸相謂言『此道必真。乃令太子捨國榮位。捐棄所重』。于時，國中八萬四千人往就太子。求為弟子。出家修道。</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha told the bhikṣus: “The prince saw an old man and a sick man, and learned of the suffering and troubles of the world. Then he saw a dead man, and his attachment to the world ceased. When he saw the śramaṇa he had an expansive, great awakening. When he dismounted his precious chariot, in the steps that he took, he gradually distanced himself from attachments. This is truly to leave the home. This is truly to cut oneself off. At that time, when the people of that kingdom heard that the prince had shaved off his hair and beard, donned religious clothing and carried an alms bowl, leaving his home to cultivate the path, they all said to one another, "This path must be true, since it has caused the prince to abandon his prestigious position in the kingdom, and to cast aside all that he valued." Thereupon, 84,000 people in the kingdom went to the prince, asking to become his disciple, to leave the home and to cultivate the path.</span>

  <h2 id="passage-45">§45</h2>
  <p>
    <span class="main-text">于時，太子即便納受。與之遊行。在在教化。從村至村。從國至國。所至之處，無不恭敬，四事供養。菩薩念言：「吾與大眾，遊行諸國。人間憒閙，此非我宜。何時當得離此群眾？閑靜之處，以求道真」。尋獲志願。於閑靜處，專精修道。復作是念：「眾生可愍。常處闇冥。受身危脆。有生、有老、有病、有死。眾苦所集，死此生彼。從彼生此。緣此苦陰， 流轉無窮。我當何時曉了苦陰， 滅生、老、死？ 」</span>
    <span class="translation">Thereupon, the prince accepted them and wandered with them, teaching wherever he went, from village to village, from kingdom to kingdom. In each place he arrived in he was respected by all. They made offerings to him of the “four necessities.” The bodhisattva thought: “I am together with a great multitude, traveling to various kingdoms. The hubbub of the world of men does not suit me. When will I be able to leave this crowd and, in a tranquil place, pursue the path and the truth?” Presently, his wish was fulfilled: in a tranquil place, he concentrated and cultivated the path. Once more, he thought, “The many beings are to be pitied. They dwell forever in darkness. The bodies they receive are fragile. They experience birth, old age, sickness and death. All manner of suffering amasses. They die here to be born there, and from there are born here. Following on this bundle of suffering, they circulate [through samsara] without end. When will I understand this bundle of suffering and eliminate birth, old age and death?”</span>
  </p>

  <h2 id="passage-46">§46</h2>
  <p>
    <span class="main-text">復作是念：「生死何從？何緣而有？」即以智慧觀察所由。「從生有老死，生是老死緣。生從有起，有是生緣。有從取起，取是有緣。取從愛起，愛是取緣。愛從受起，受是愛緣。受從觸起，觸是受緣。觸從六入起，六入是觸緣。六入從名色起，名色是六入緣。名色從識起，識是名色緣。識從行起，行是識緣。行從癡起，癡是行緣。</span>
    <span class="translation">Again he thought: “Where do life and death come from? What causes them to exist?” Then, with insight, he examined their origin: “From birth there is old age and death; birth is the cause of old age and death. Birth arises from being; being is the cause of birth. Being arises from grasping; grasping is the cause of being. Grasping arises from craving; craving is the cause of grasping. Craving arises from sensation; sensation is the cause of craving. Sensation arises from contact; contact is the cause of sensation. Contact arises from the 'six entrances'; the 'six entrances' are the cause of contact. The 'six entrances' arise from name and form; name and form are the cause of the 'six entrances.' Name and form arise from consciousness; consciousness is the cause of name and form. Consciousness arises from dispositions; dispositions are the cause of consciousness. Dispositions arise from ignorance; ignorance is the cause of dispositions.</span>

    <span class="main-text">是為，緣癡有行。緣行有識。緣識有名色。緣名色有六入。緣六入有觸。緣觸有受。緣受有愛。緣愛有取。緣取有有。緣有有生。緣生有老、病、死、憂、悲、苦、惱。此苦盛陰，緣生而有。是為苦集」。菩薩思惟苦集陰時，生智、生眼、生覺、生明、生通、生慧、生證。</span>
    <span class="translation">That is to say: Following from ignorance there are dispositions; following from dispositions there is consciousness; following from consciousness there is name and form; following from name and form there are the 'six entrances'; following from the 'six entrances' there is contact; following contact there is sensation; following sensation there is craving; following craving there is grasping; following grasping there is being; following being there is birth; following birth there is old age, sickness, death, worry, sorrow, pain, and vexation. This suffering forms a great mass that comes to exist with birth. This is the accumulation of suffering.” When the bodhisattva reflected on the origin of the mass of suffering, he produced knowledge, vision, perception, clarification, understanding, wisdom and realization.</span>
  </p>

  <h2 id="passage-47">§47</h2>
  <p>
    <span class="main-text">於時，菩薩復自思惟：「何等無，故老死無？何等滅，故老死滅」。即以智慧觀察所由：「生無故老死無，生滅故老死滅。有無故生無，有滅故生滅。取無故有無，取滅故有滅。愛無故取無，愛滅故取滅。受無故愛無，受滅故愛滅。觸無故受無，觸滅故受滅。六入無故觸無，六入滅故觸滅。名色無故六入無，名色滅故六入滅。識無故名色無，識滅故名色滅。行無故識無，行滅故識滅。癡無故行無，癡滅故行滅。</span>
    <span class="translation">Thereupon the bodhisattva reflected to himself, “Through what type of ceasing would old age and death cease? Through what type of extinction would old age and death be extinguished?” Then, with insight he examined their source: If birth ceased there would be no old age and no death. If birth were extinguished old age and death would be extinguished. If there is no being, there is no birth; if being is extinguished, birth is extinguished. If there is no grasping, being is extinguished; if grasping is extinguished, being is extinguished. If there is no craving, there is no grasping. When craving is extinguished, grasping is extinguished. Without sensation, there is no craving; when sensation is extinguished, craving is extinguished. Without contact, there is no sensation; when contact is extinguished, sensation is extinguished. Without the 'six entrances' there is no contact; when the 'six entrances' are extinguished, contact is extinguished. Without name and form, there are no 'six entrances'; when name and form are extinguished, the 'six entrances' are extinguished. Without consciousness, there is no name or form; when consciousness is extinguished, name and form are extinguished.

Without ignorance, there are no dispositions; when ignorance is extinguished, the dispositions are extinguished.</span>

At that time, the bodhisattva contemplated the twelve-fold chain of causation backwards and forwards. He knew it truthfully. He saw it truthfully. Thereupon, there on his seat, he achieved anuttarasamyaksambodhi.</span>

    <span class="main-text">毘婆尸佛初成道時，多修二觀：一曰安隱觀、二曰出離觀。</span>
    <span class="translation">When the Buddha Vipaśyin had just completed the path, he mostly practiced two types of contemplation: one is called the contemplation of serenity; the second is called the contemplation of separation.</span>
  </p>

  <h2 id="passage-49">§49</h2>
  <p>
    <span class="main-text">毘婆尸佛於閑靜處復作是念：「我今已得此無上法。甚深微妙，難解難見。息滅、清淨，智者所知。非是凡愚所能及也。斯由眾生異忍、異見、異受、異學。依彼異見，各樂所求，各務所習。是故於此甚深因緣，不能解了。然愛盡涅槃，倍復難知。我若為說，彼必不解。更生觸擾。」作是念已，即便默然不復說法。</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha Vipaśyin in a secluded, tranquil place thought as follows: "Today I have attained this supreme Dharma. It is profoundly subtle, difficult to understand, difficult to see. Extinguished and pure, it is known by the wise, and not something the foolish can attain. The reason for this is that beings have different degrees of tolerance, different views, different sensations, different levels of education. And according to their different views, each delights in his own pursuits, each devotes himself to his own customs. Hence, on account of these profound conditions, they cannot understand. Yet, if they want to completely achieve nirvana, it is twice as difficult to know. If I were to eplain it, they most certainly would not understand. Moreover, it would be bothersome to me." Having thought this he was then silent and did not preach the Dharma.</span>
  </p>

  <h2 id="passage-50">§50</h2>
  <p>
    <span class="main-text">時，梵天王知毘婆尸如來所念。即自思惟：「念此世間便為敗壞，甚可哀愍。毘婆尸佛乃得知此深妙之法，而不欲說」。譬如力士屈伸臂頃，從梵天宮忽然來下。立於佛前。頭面禮足。却住一面。時，梵天王右膝著地。叉手合掌白佛言：「唯願世尊以時說法。今此眾生塵垢微薄、諸根猛利、有恭敬心、易可開化。畏怖後世無救之罪。能滅惡法、出生善道」。</span>
    <span class="translation">At the time, King Brahmadeva knew what the Thus-Come-One Vipaśyin was thinking. He then reflected to himself: "Thinking that this world is corrupt, sad and pitiful, Vipaśyin Buddha knows this profoundly marvelous Dharma, yet does not want to preach it." As quickly as a strong man flexes an arm, he came suddenly down from the Brahma palace, stood before the Buddha, paid reverence, touching his forehead to the Buddha's feet, and withdrew to one side. Then, King Brahma knelt with his right knee to the ground, pressed his palms together with fingers interlaced[Note 3] and addressed the Buddha, saying: "I hope only that the World-Honored-One will preach the Dharma in a timely fashion. The beings of today are only slightly tainted. Their faculties are sharp. They are reverential and easily taught. They fear sins that cannot be redeemed in a future life. They can destroy evil teaching and give rise to the good path."</span>
  </p>

  <h2 id="passage-51">§51</h2>
  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛告梵王：「如是。如是。如汝所言。但我於閑靜處，默自思念『所得正法，甚深微妙。若為彼說，彼必不解，更生觸擾』。故我默然不欲說法。我從無數阿僧祇劫，勤苦不懈，修無上行。今始獲此難得之法。若為婬、怒、癡眾生說者，必不承用。徒自勞疲。此法微妙。與世相反。眾生染欲。愚冥所覆，不能信解。梵王，我觀如此。是以默然不欲說法」。</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha told King Brahma: “Just so, just so. It is as you have said. However, when I was in a tranquil place, I thought to myself, 'The true Dharma that I have attained is profoundly subtle. If I explain it to them, they will no doubt fail to understand it, and this will be bothersome to me.' Hence I was silent, not wishing to preach the Dharma. For countless asaṃkhya kalpas I have been diligent, without rest, cultivating the highest practice. Only now have I acquired this Dharma that is so difficult to attain. If I explain it for the lustful, angry, ignorant multitude, they will certainly not be able to accept it. I will tire myself pointlessly. This Dharma is subtle, and at odds with the world. The multitude is stained by desire; the foolish are blanketed by darkness. They cannot believe or understand it. King Brahma, on observing these things, I remained for this reason silent, not wanting to preach the Dharma.”</span>
  </p>

  <h2 id="passage-52">§52</h2>
  <p>
    <span class="main-text">時，梵天王復重勸請。慇懃懇惻。至于再三：「世尊，若不說法，今此世間便為壞敗。甚可哀愍。唯願世尊以時敷演。勿使眾生墜落餘趣」。爾時，世尊三聞梵王慇懃勸請，即以佛眼觀視世界眾生，垢有厚薄，根有利鈍，教有難易。易受教者畏後世罪。能滅惡法，出生善道。譬如優鉢羅花、鉢頭摩華、鳩勿頭華、分陀利華。或有始出汙泥，未至水者。或有已出，與水平者。或有出水，未敷開者。然皆不為水所染著，易可開敷。世界眾生，亦復如是。</span>
    <span class="translation">Presently, King Brahma again entreated the Buddha, sincerely and devoutly, repeatedly saying: “World-Honored-One, if you do not preach the Dharma, today our world will fall to ruins. What a great pity this would be. I only hope that the World-Honored-One will explain the Dharma in a timely fashion, and not allow the multitude to fall to other destinies.” At that time, the World- Honored-One listened repeatedly to the earnest entreaties of King Brahma, and with his Buddha eye observed the creatures of the world. He saw that they were tainted to lesser and greater degrees, that the faculties of some were sharp and others dull, that some were hard to teach and others easy. Those who are easy to teach fear committing sins that will affect them in later lives. They can eliminate evil and produce good. It is like the utpala flower, the padma flower, the kumuda flower and the puṇḍarīka flower. Some emerge from the mud but do not reach the surface of the water. Some emerge from the mud and are level with the surface of the water. Some rise above the water, but have yet to blossom. Yet none are stained by the water, and all can be easily opened. The multitudes of the world are like this.</span>

    <span class="translation">At that time, when King Brahma learned that the Buddha had accepted his invitation he was overjoyed. Circumambulating the Buddha three times, he paid reverence, touching his forehead to the Buddha's feet. In an instant, Brahma disappeared. Not long after he had departed, the Thus-Come-One reflected: “To whom should I preach the Dharma first?” Then he thought to himself, “I will enter the city of Paṇḍhu, and expound the sweet dew doctrine first to the prince Tiṣya and to the great minister Skanda.” Thereupon, the World-Honored-One, in the time it takes a strong man to flex an arm, disappeared from the tree of enlightenment, and arrived before king Paṇḍhu in the city of Paṇḍhu.

He went to the place where the two men were and conveyed all that the Buddha had told him. When the two men heard this, they went to the place where the Buddha was, and, paying reverence by touching their foreheads to his feet, withdrew to sit to one side. The Buddha systematically explained the Dharma, demonstrating the benefit and joy of his teachings. He gave discourses on charity, discourses on morality, and discourses on how to be born in the heavens, on how the evils of desire are unclean and how valuing afflictions is a calamity.

    <span class="main-text">時，首陀會天見佛默然許可。即禮佛足。忽然不現。還至天上。其去未久。佛告諸比丘：「今此城內，比丘眾多。宜各分布。遊行教化。至六年已，還集說戒」。時，諸比丘受佛教已。執持衣鉢。禮佛而去。</span>
    <span class="translation">Presently, seeing that the Buddha had silently approved, the devas of Śuddhāvāsa prostrated themselves at the Buddha's feet and, all at once, disappeared to return to their heaven. Not long after they had gone, the Buddha announced to the bhikṣus: “Today in this city there is an assembly of many bhikṣus. It is right that you should disperse to wander and preach. After six years, you should return here to gather to recite the precepts.” Then, having received these instructions from the Buddha, the bhikṣus took up their robes and bowls, paid reverence, touching their foreheads to the feet of the Buddha, and left.</span>

    <span class="main-text">時，首陀會天於一年後告諸比丘：「汝等遊行已過一年。餘有五年。汝等當知，訖六年已，還城說戒」。如是至于六年。天復告言：「六年已滿。當還說戒」。時，諸比丘聞天語已。攝持衣鉢。還槃頭城。至鹿野苑毘婆尸佛所。頭面禮足。却坐一面。</span>
    <span class="translation">In time, the devas of Śuddhāvāsa Heaven a year later announced to all of the bhikṣus: “You have now wandered for over a year. Five years remain. You should know that when six years have passed you are to return to the city to recite the precepts.” In this way they reached the sixth year. The devas then announced: “It is a full six years. You should return to recite the precepts.” At the time, having heard what the devas said, the bhikṣus, robes and bowls in hand, returned to the city of Paṇḍhu. Arriving at the place of the Buddha Vipaśyin in the Deer Park, they touched their foreheads to his feet and retreated to one side.</span>

    <span class="main-text">爾時，如來於大眾前上昇虛空。結加趺坐。講說戒經。忍辱為第一。佛說涅槃最。不以除鬚髮害他為沙門。時，首陀會天去佛不遠。</span>
    <span class="translation">At that time, the Thus-Come-One rose up into the air before the great assembly. Seated with legs crossed in the lotus posture, he delivered the scriptures on the precepts, placing tolerance foremost. The Buddha explained that nirvana is the ultimate and that a śramaṇa should not simply shave his head and then bring harm to others. Now at that time the devas of Śuddhāvāsa Heaven were not far from the Buddha.</span>

    <span class="main-text">爾時，世尊告諸比丘：「我自思念，昔一時於羅閱城耆闍崛山，時生是念『我所生處，無所不遍。唯除首陀會天。設生彼天。則不還此』。我時，比丘，復生是念『我欲至無造天上』。時，我如壯士屈伸臂頃，於此間沒，現於彼天。時，彼諸天見我至彼。頭面作禮。於一面立。而白我言『我等皆是毘婆尸如來弟子。從彼佛化，故來生此』。具說彼佛因緣本末。又尸棄佛、毘沙婆佛、拘樓孫佛、拘那含佛、迦葉佛、釋迦牟尼佛，皆是我師。我從受化，故來生此」。亦說諸佛因緣本末。至生阿迦尼吒諸天，亦復如是。</span>
    <span class="translation">At that time, the World-Honored-One announced to the bhikṣus: “I recall, long ago, at one time on the mountain of Gṛdhrakūṭa by the city of Rājagraha I had this thought, 'I have been born in every place there is, with the exception of the Śuddhāvāsa heavens. If I had been born there, then I would not have returned here.' At the time, bhikṣus, I further had this thought, “I want to go to the Heaven that is Not Created (Avṛha, one of the five Śuddhāvāsas).' Then, in the time it takes a strong man to flex an arm, I disappeared from the mountain and appeared in that heaven. At the time, the devas, seeing me arrive there, touched their foreheads to my feet and paid reverence, standing to one side. They addressed me, saying 'We are the disciples of the Thus-Come-One Vipaśyin. We were taught by that Buddha and that is why we came to be born here. He fully explained the circumstances of that Buddha from start to finish. Also, the Buddhas Śikhin, Viśvabhu, Krakucchanda, Kanakamuni, Kāśyapa and [you] Śākyamuni have all been our teachers.[Note 4] We have received instruction from them and for this reason have come to be born here.' They also explained all of the circumstances of the various Buddhas from start to finish. I also went among the devas born in Akaniṣṭha Heaven where the same thing happened.”</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="main-text">佛說此大因緣經已，諸比丘聞佛所說。歡喜奉行。</span>
    <span class="translation">The Buddha had explained the great matters of this scripture. The bhikṣus, having heard what the Buddha said, happily carried out his teachings.</span>
