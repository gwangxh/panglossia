擴廓帖木兒
擴廓帖木兒，沈丘人。本王姓，小字保保，元平章察罕帖木兒甥也。察罕養為子，順帝賜名擴廓帖木兒。汝、潁盜起，中原大亂，元師久無功。至正十二年，察罕起義兵，戰河南、北，擊賊關中、河東，復汴梁，走劉福通，平山東，降田豐，滅賊幾盡。既而總大軍圍益都，田豐叛，察罕為王士誠所刺，事具《元史》。察罕既死，順帝即軍中拜擴廓太尉、中書平章政事、知樞密院事，如察罕官。帥兵圍益都，穴地而入，克之。執豐、士誠，剖其心以祭察罕，縛陳猱頭等二十余人獻闕下。東取莒州，山東地悉定。至正二十二年也。

Kuo Kuo Temur, a native of Shenqiu, originally bore the royal surname and was nicknamed Baobao. He was the nephew of Yuan's Prime Minister Chahan Temur. Chahan adopted him as a son, and Emperor Shun bestowed upon him the name Kuo Kuo Temur. When bandits arose in Ru and Ying, causing great chaos in the Central Plains, the Yuan army had long been unsuccessful. In the twelfth year of Zhizheng, Chahan raised an army, fought in Henan and the north, attacked bandits in Guanzhong and Hedong, recaptured Bianliang, drove away Liu Futong, pacified Shandong, subdued Tian Feng, and nearly exterminated the bandits. Later, he led a large army to besiege Yidu. Tian Feng rebelled, and Chahan was assassinated by Wang Shicheng. The details are recorded in the "History of Yuan." After Chahan's death, Emperor Shun appointed Kuo Kuo as Grand Commandant, Prime Minister of the Central Secretariat, and Director of the Privy Council, holding the same positions as Chahan. He led the army to besiege Yidu, dug tunnels to enter, and captured it. He captured Feng and Shicheng, cut out their hearts to sacrifice to Chahan, and bound over twenty people, including Chen Naotou, to present to the court. He then took Juzhou in the east, and the entire Shandong region was pacified. This was in the twenty-second year of Zhizheng.

初，察罕定晉、冀，孛羅帖木兒在大同，以兵爭其地，數相攻，朝廷下詔和解，終不聽。擴廓既平齊地，引軍還，駐太原，與孛羅構難如故。會朝臣老的沙、禿堅獲罪于太子，出奔孛羅，孛羅匿之。詔削孛羅官，解其兵柄。孛羅遂舉兵反，犯京師，殺丞相搠思監，自為左丞相，老的沙為平章，禿堅知樞密院。太子求援于擴廓，擴廓遣其將白鎖住以萬騎入衛，戰不利，奉太子奔太原。逾年，擴廓以太子令舉兵討孛羅，入大同，進薄大都。順帝乃襲殺孛羅於朝。擴廓從太子入覲，以為太傅、左丞相。當是時，微擴廓，太子幾殆。擴廓功雖高，起行間，驟至相位，中朝舊臣多忌之者。而擴廓久典軍，亦不樂在內，居兩月，即請出治兵，南平江、淮。詔許之，封河南王，俾總天下兵，代皇太子出征，分省中官屬之半以自隨。鹵簿甲仗互數十里，軍容甚盛。時太祖已滅陳友諒，盡有江、楚地，張士誠據淮東、浙西。擴廓知南軍強，未可輕進，乃駐軍河南，檄關中四將軍會師大舉。四將軍者，李思齊、張思道、孔興、脫列伯也。

Initially, Chahan pacified Jin and Ji, while Boluo Temur was in Datong, contending for the territory with his army, leading to frequent conflicts. The court issued an edict for reconciliation, but Boluo did not comply. After pacifying the Qi region, Kuo Kuo led his army back and stationed in Taiyuan, continuing the conflict with Boluo. At that time, court officials Laodesha and Tukjian offended the Crown Prince and fled to Boluo, who sheltered them. An edict was issued to strip Boluo of his official position and military command. Boluo then raised an army in rebellion, attacked the capital, killed Prime Minister Shuosijian, and declared himself Left Prime Minister, with Laodesha as Prime Minister and Tukjian as Director of the Privy Council. The Crown Prince sought assistance from Kuo Kuo, who sent his general Baisuoju with ten thousand cavalry to protect the capital. The battle was unfavorable, and they escorted the Crown Prince to Taiyuan. The following year, Kuo Kuo, under the Crown Prince's order, raised an army to attack Boluo, entered Datong, and advanced towards the capital. Emperor Shun then ambushed and killed Boluo in the court. Kuo Kuo accompanied the Crown Prince to the capital and was appointed Grand Tutor and Left Prime Minister. At that time, without Kuo Kuo, the Crown Prince would have been in great danger. Although Kuo Kuo's achievements were significant, he rose quickly to high office, causing jealousy among the old ministers of the central court. Kuo Kuo, having long commanded the army, was also not content to stay in the capital. After two months, he requested to lead the army to pacify Jiang and Huai in the south. The edict granted his request, conferring him the title of King of Henan, giving him command of all the armies, and allowing him to take half of the provincial officials with him. His military procession stretched for dozens of miles, displaying great military might. At that time, the Taizu had already defeated Chen Youliang and controlled the Jiang and Chu regions, while Zhang Shicheng held Huai East and Zhe West. Kuo Kuo, knowing the strength of the southern army, did not advance rashly but stationed his army in Henan, summoning the four generals of Guanzhong for a grand campaign. These four generals were Li Siqi, Zhang Sidao, Kong Xing, and Tuo Liebo.

思齊，羅山人，與察罕同起義兵，齒位略相埒。得檄大怒曰：「吾與若父交，若發未燥，敢檄我耶！」令其下一甲不得出武關。思道等亦皆不聽調。擴廓歎曰：「吾奉詔總天下兵，而鎮將不受節制，何討賊為！」乃遣其弟脫因帖木兒以一軍屯濟南，防遏南軍，而自引兵西入關，攻思齊等。思齊等會兵長安，盟於含元殿舊基，並力拒擴廓。相持經年，數百戰未能決。順帝使使諭令罷兵，專事江、淮。擴廓欲遂定思齊等，然後引軍東。乃遣其驍將貊高趨河中，欲出不意搗鳳翔，覆思齊巢穴。貊高所將多孛羅部曲，行至衛輝，軍變，脅貊高叛擴廓，襲衛輝、彰德據之，罪狀擴廓於朝。

Siqi, a native of Luoshan, raised an army with Chahan, and their ranks were roughly equal. Upon receiving the summons, he was greatly angered and said, "I had dealings with your father, and you dare to summon me while your hair is still wet!" He ordered his subordinates not to leave Wuguan. Zhang Sidao and others also refused to comply. Kuo Kuo sighed and said, "I have been commanded to lead all the armies, yet the garrison commanders do not obey. How can I suppress the bandits?" He then sent his brother Tuoyin Temur with an army to garrison Jinan to block the southern army, while he led his forces west into Guanzhong to attack Siqi and others. Siqi and others gathered their forces in Chang'an, swore an oath at the old site of Hanyuan Hall, and jointly resisted Kuo Kuo. They were locked in a stalemate for a year, with hundreds of battles undecided. Emperor Shun sent envoys to order them to cease hostilities and focus on Jiang and Huai. Kuo Kuo wanted to first settle the matter with Siqi and others before moving east. He then sent his valiant general Maogao to rush to Hezhong, intending to unexpectedly strike Fengxiang and destroy Siqi's base. Maogao's troops were mostly from Boluo's division. When they reached Weihui, the army mutinied, forcing Maogao to rebel against Kuo Kuo, seizing Weihui and Zhangde, and accusing Kuo Kuo of crimes at the court.

初，太子之奔太原也，欲用唐肅宗靈武故事自立。擴廓不可。及還京師，皇后諭指令以重兵擁太子入城，脅順帝禪位。擴廓未至京三十里，留其軍，以數騎入朝。由是太子銜之，而順帝亦心忌擴廓。廷臣嘩言擴廓受命平江、淮，乃西攻關中，今罷兵不奉詔，跋扈有狀。及貊高奏至，順帝乃削擴廓太傅、中書左丞相，令以河南王就食邑汝南，分其軍隸諸將；而以貊高知樞密院事兼平章，總河北軍，賜其軍號「忠義功臣」。太子開撫軍院于京師，總制天下兵馬，專備擴廓。

Initially, when the Crown Prince fled to Taiyuan, he wanted to establish himself following the example of Tang Suzong at Lingwu. Kuo Kuo opposed this. When they returned to the capital, the Empress instructed that the Crown Prince should enter the city with a large army, forcing Emperor Shun to abdicate. Kuo Kuo, still thirty miles from the capital, left his army and entered the court with a few riders. Because of this, the Crown Prince harbored resentment, and Emperor Shun also became wary of Kuo Kuo. Court officials loudly criticized Kuo Kuo for being ordered to pacify Jiang and Huai but instead attacking Guanzhong, now ceasing hostilities and not following orders, showing signs of insubordination. When Maogao's report arrived, Emperor Shun stripped Kuo Kuo of his titles of Grand Tutor and Left Prime Minister, ordered him to take up residence in Ruyang as the King of Henan, and divided his army among various generals. Maogao was appointed Director of the Privy Council and Prime Minister, commanding the Hebei army, and was given the honorary title "Loyal and Righteous Meritorious Official." The Crown Prince established the Military Affairs Office in the capital, overseeing all the armies, specifically to guard against Kuo Kuo.

擴廓既受詔，退軍澤州，其部將關保亦歸於朝。朝廷知擴廓勢孤，乃詔李思齊等東出關，與貊高合攻擴廓，而令關保以兵戍太原。擴廓憤甚，引軍據太原，盡殺朝廷所置官吏。於是順帝下詔盡削擴廓官爵，令諸軍四面討之。是時明兵已下山東，收大樑。梁王阿魯溫，察罕父也，以河南降。脫因帖木兒敗走，餘皆望風降遁，無一人抗者。既迫潼關，思齊等倉皇解兵西歸，而貊高、關保皆為擴廓所擒殺。順帝大恐，下詔歸罪於太子，罷撫軍院，悉復擴廓官，令與思齊等分道南討。詔下一月，明兵已逼大都，順帝北走。擴廓入援不及，大都遂陷，距察罕死時僅六年雲。

After receiving the edict, Kuo Kuo withdrew his army to Zezhou, and his general Guan Bao also returned to the court. The court, knowing Kuo Kuo's isolated position, ordered Li Siqi and others to move east out of the pass to join Maogao in attacking Kuo Kuo, while Guan Bao was ordered to garrison Taiyuan. Kuo Kuo, greatly angered, led his army to occupy Taiyuan, killing all the officials appointed by the court. Emperor Shun then issued an edict stripping Kuo Kuo of all his titles and ordering all armies to attack him from all sides. At that time, Ming forces had already taken Shandong and captured Daliang. King Aluwen of Liang, Chahan's father, surrendered Henan. Tuoyin Temur fled in defeat, and the rest surrendered or fled without resistance. When they reached Tongguan, Siqi and others hastily disbanded their forces and retreated west, while Maogao and Guan Bao were captured and killed by Kuo Kuo. Emperor Shun, greatly alarmed, issued an edict blaming the Crown Prince, disbanded the Military Affairs Office, and restored all of Kuo Kuo's titles, ordering him to join Siqi and others in a southern campaign. A month after the edict, Ming forces were already approaching the capital, and Emperor Shun fled north. Kuo Kuo's reinforcements arrived too late, and the capital fell, just six years after Chahan's death.

明兵已定元都，將軍湯和等自澤州徇山西。擴廓遣將禦之，戰于韓店，明師大敗。會順帝自開平命擴廓復大都，擴廓乃北出雁門，將由保安徑居庸以攻北平。徐達、常遇春乘虛搗太原，擴廓還救。部將豁鼻馬潛約降於明。明兵夜劫營，營中驚潰。擴廓倉卒以十八騎北走，明兵遂西入關。思齊以臨洮降。思道走寧夏，其弟良臣以慶陽降，既而復叛，明兵破誅之。於是元臣皆入於明，唯擴廓擁兵塞上，西北邊苦之。

After Ming forces had secured the Yuan capital, General Tang He and others advanced from Zezhou to Shanxi. Kuo Kuo sent generals to resist them, and they fought at Handian, where the Ming army suffered a great defeat. At that time, Emperor Shun, from Kaiping, ordered Kuo Kuo to retake the capital. Kuo Kuo then moved north out of Yanmen, intending to attack Beiping via Baoding and Juyong. Xu Da and Chang Yuchun took advantage of the situation to strike Taiyuan, forcing Kuo Kuo to return for its defense. His general Huobima secretly negotiated surrender to the Ming. The Ming army launched a night raid on the camp, causing panic and collapse. Kuo Kuo fled north with eighteen riders, and the Ming army then advanced west into the pass. Siqi surrendered at Lintao. Sidao fled to Ningxia, and his brother Liangchen surrendered at Qingyang but later rebelled again and was executed by the Ming army. Thus, all Yuan officials joined the Ming, except for Kuo Kuo, who held his forces at the border, causing suffering in the northwest.

洪武三年，太祖命大將軍徐達總大兵出西安，搗定西。擴廓方圍蘭州，趨赴之。戰于沈兒峪，大敗，盡亡其眾，獨與妻子數人北走，至黃河，得流木以渡，遂奔和林。時順帝崩，太子嗣立，復任以國事。逾年，太祖復遣大將軍徐達、左副將軍李文忠、征西將軍馮勝將十五萬眾，分道出塞取擴廓。大將軍至嶺北，與擴廓遇，大敗，死者數萬人。劉基嘗言于太祖曰：「擴廓未可輕也。」至是帝思其言，謂晉王曰：「吾用兵未嘗敗北。今諸將自請深入，敗于和林，輕信無謀，致多殺士卒，不可不戒。」明年，擴廓復攻雁門，命諸將嚴為之備，自是明兵希出塞矣。其後，擴廓從其主徙金山，卒于哈剌那海之衙庭，其妻毛氏亦自經死，蓋洪武八年也。

In the third year of Hongwu, Taizu ordered General Xu Da to lead a large army out of Xi'an to attack Dingxi. Kuo Kuo was besieging Lanzhou at the time and rushed to confront them. They fought at Shen'er Valley, where Kuo Kuo suffered a great defeat, losing all his troops. He fled north with only a few family members, reached the Yellow River, and crossed it using floating logs, eventually fleeing to Hohhot. At that time, Emperor Shun had died, and the Crown Prince succeeded him, reinstating Kuo Kuo to his former positions. The following year, Taizu again sent General Xu Da, Deputy General Li Wenzhong, and General Feng Sheng with 150,000 troops, divided into several routes, to capture Kuo Kuo. The main army reached Lingbei and encountered Kuo Kuo, resulting in a great defeat with tens of thousands of casualties. Liu Ji once told Taizu, "Kuo Kuo should not be underestimated." Remembering this, the emperor said to the Prince of Jin, "I have never been defeated in battle. Now, the generals requested to advance deeply and were defeated at Hohhot due to their overconfidence and lack of strategy, causing many soldiers to die. This must be a lesson." The following year, Kuo Kuo attacked Yanmen again, and the generals were ordered to prepare strictly. From then on, Ming forces rarely ventured beyond the pass. Later, Kuo Kuo followed his lord to move to Jinshan and died in the court of Haranahai. His wife, Lady Mao, also hanged herself. This was in the eighth year of Hongwu.

初，察罕破山東，江、淮震動。太祖遣使通好。元遣戶部尚書張昶、郎中馬合謀浮海如江東，授太祖榮祿大夫、江西等處行中書省平章政事，賜以龍衣禦酒。甫至而察罕被刺，太祖遂不受，殺馬合謀，以張昶才，留官之。及擴廓視師河南，太祖乃復遣使通好，擴廓輒留使者不遣。凡七致書，皆不答。既出塞，復遣人招諭，亦不應。最後使李思齊往。始至，則待以禮。尋使騎士送歸，至塞下，辭曰：「主帥有命，請公留一物為別。」思齊曰：「吾遠來無所齎。」騎士曰：「願得公一臂。」思齊知不免，遂斷與之。還，未幾死。太祖以是心敬擴廓。一日，大會諸將，問曰：「天下奇男子誰也？」皆對曰：「常遇春將不過萬人，橫行無敵，真奇男子。」太祖笑曰：「遇春雖人傑，吾得而臣之。吾不能臣王保保，其人奇男子也。」竟冊其妹為秦王妃。

Initially, when Chahan pacified Shandong, Jiang and Huai were greatly disturbed. Taizu sent envoys to establish friendly relations. The Yuan sent Minister of Revenue Zhang Chang and Langzhong Ma Hemou across the sea to Jiangdong, conferring upon Taizu the title of Grand Guardian of Honor and Prime Minister of the Jiangxi Provincial Secretariat, and gifting him dragon robes and imperial wine. Upon their arrival, Chahan was assassinated, and Taizu refused to accept the titles, killing Ma Hemou but retaining Zhang Chang for his talent. When Kuo Kuo led his army to Henan, Taizu again sent envoys to establish friendly relations, but Kuo Kuo detained the envoys and did not send them back. He sent seven letters, all unanswered. After Kuo Kuo left the pass, Taizu sent another envoy to persuade him, but he did not respond. Finally, he sent Li Siqi. Upon his arrival, Kuo Kuo treated him with courtesy. Later, he sent a rider to escort him back. At the pass, the rider said, "The commander has ordered that you leave something as a memento." Li Siqi replied, "I have nothing to give." The rider said, "I would like your arm." Knowing he could not escape, Li Siqi cut off his arm and gave it to him. He returned and soon died. Because of this, Taizu respected Kuo Kuo. One day, at a grand assembly of generals, Taizu asked, "Who is the most extraordinary man in the world?" They all replied, "Chang Yuchun, with no more than ten thousand men, is invincible and truly extraordinary." Taizu laughed and said, "Although Yuchun is a hero, I can make him my subject. I cannot make Wang Baobao my subject; he is the truly extraordinary man." He eventually betrothed his sister to the Prince of Qin.

張昶仕明，累官中書省參知政事，有才辨，明習故事，裁決如流，甚見信任。自以故元臣，心嘗戀戀。會太祖縱降人北還，昶附私書訪其子存亡。楊憲得書稿以聞，下吏按問。昶大書牘背曰：「身在江南，心思塞北。」太祖乃殺之。而擴廓幕下士不屈節縱出塞者，有蔡子英。

Zhang Chang served the Ming, rising to the position of Deputy Minister of the Central Secretariat. He was talented and eloquent, well-versed in historical precedents, and made decisions swiftly, earning great trust. However, as a former Yuan official, he always harbored feelings of longing. When Taizu allowed surrendered people to return north, Zhang Chang sent a private letter inquiring about the survival of his son. Yang Xian discovered the draft and reported it. The officials interrogated him, and Zhang Chang wrote on the back of the letter, "My body is in Jiangnan, but my heart longs for the north." Taizu then executed him. Among Kuo Kuo's subordinates who did not compromise and were released beyond the pass was Cai Ziying.

蔡子英
子英，永寧人，元至正中進士。察罕開府河南，辟參軍事，累薦至行省參政。元亡，從擴廓走定西。明兵克定西，擴廓軍敗，子英單騎走關中，亡入南山。太祖聞其名，使人繪形求得之，傳詣京師。至江濱，亡去，變姓名，賃舂。久之，復被獲。械過洛陽，見湯和，長揖不拜。抑之跪，不肯。和怒，爇火焚其須，不動。其妻適在洛，請與相見，子英避不肯見。至京，太祖命脫械以禮遇之，授以官，不受。退而上書曰：「陛下乘時應運，削平群雄，薄海內外，莫不賓貢。臣鼎魚漏網，假息南山。曩者見獲，復得脫亡。七年之久，重煩有司追跡。而陛下以萬乘之尊，全匹夫之節，不降天誅，反療其疾，易冠裳，賜酒饌，授以官爵，陛下之量包乎天地矣。臣感恩無極，非不欲自竭犬馬，但名義所存，不敢輒渝初志。自惟身本韋布，智識淺陋，過蒙主將知薦，仕至七命，躍馬食肉十有五年，愧無尺寸以報國士之遇。及國家破亡，又復失節，何面目見天下士。管子曰：『禮義廉恥，國之四維。』今陛下創業垂統，正當挈持大經大法，垂示子孫臣民。奈何欲以無禮義、寡廉恥之俘囚，廁諸維新之朝、賢士大夫之列哉！臣日夜思維，咎往昔之不死，至於今日，分宜自裁。陛下待臣以恩禮，臣固不敢賣死立名，亦不敢偷生苟祿。若察臣之愚，全臣之志，禁錮海南，畢其餘命，則雖死之日，猶生之年。或王蠋閉戶以自縊，李芾闔門以自屠，彼非惡榮利而樂死亡，顧義之所在，雖湯鑊有不得避也。渺焉之軀，上愧古人，死有餘恨，惟陛下裁察。」帝覽其書，益重之，館之儀曹。忽一夜大哭不止。人問其故，曰：「無他，思舊君耳。」帝知不可奪，洪武九年十二月命有司送出塞，令從故主于和林。

Cai Ziying, a native of Yongning, was a Jinshi during the Zhizheng period of the Yuan dynasty. When Chahan established his headquarters in Henan, he appointed Cai Ziying as a military advisor, and he was repeatedly recommended, eventually becoming Deputy Governor of the province. After the fall of the Yuan, he followed Kuo Kuo to Dingxi. When Ming forces captured Dingxi, Kuo Kuo's army was defeated, and Cai Ziying fled alone to Guanzhong, eventually hiding in the southern mountains. Taizu, hearing of his reputation, sent people to capture him and bring him to the capital. Upon reaching the riverbank, he escaped, changed his name, and worked as a laborer. After a long time, he was captured again. While being transported through Luoyang, he met Tang He, greeted him with a long bow but refused to kneel. When forced to kneel, he still refused. Tang He, angered, burned his beard with fire, but he remained unmoved. His wife, who was in Luoyang, requested to see him, but Cai Ziying avoided her. Upon reaching the capital, Taizu ordered his shackles removed and treated him with courtesy, offering him an official position, which he declined. He then submitted a letter saying, "Your Majesty, you have seized the opportunity and pacified the heroes, and now the entire realm submits to you. I, a fish that escaped the net, sought refuge in the southern mountains. Previously captured, I managed to escape again. For seven years, I have been pursued by officials. Yet, Your Majesty, with your supreme authority, preserved my integrity, did not impose heavenly punishment, but instead treated my illness, changed my attire, bestowed wine and food, and offered me an official position. Your Majesty's magnanimity encompasses heaven and earth. I am deeply grateful, but I cannot abandon my principles. Reflecting on my humble origins and limited knowledge, I was fortunate to be recognized and recommended by my commander, serving in seven positions, riding horses, and eating meat for fifteen years, yet I am ashamed to have no achievements to repay the nation's trust. When the country fell, I lost my integrity. How can I face the scholars of the world? Guan Zi said, 'Ritual, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four pillars of the state.' Now, Your Majesty, having established your rule, should uphold the great principles and laws, setting an example for future generations. How can you place a prisoner without integrity among the newly established court and the ranks of virtuous scholars? I reflect day and night, regretting not dying earlier, and now I should end my life. Your Majesty has treated me with kindness and respect, and I dare not seek death to gain fame, nor live to seek fortune. If Your Majesty understands my foolishness and respects my will, banish me to Hainan to live out my remaining days. Then, even if I die, it will be as if I am still alive. Wang Zhu closed his door to hang himself, and Li Fu slaughtered himself and his family. They did not despise honor and wealth but valued righteousness above all, even if it meant facing death. My insignificant self, ashamed before the ancients, will die with regret. I hope Your Majesty understands." The emperor, reading his letter, respected him even more and housed him in the Ministry of Rites. One night, he suddenly cried loudly without stopping. When asked why, he said, "I am thinking of my former lord." The emperor knew he could not be swayed and, in December of the ninth year of Hongwu, ordered officials to send him beyond the pass to follow his former lord to Hohhot.

陳友定
附 伯顏子中 等
陳友定，一名有定，字安國，福清人，徙居汀之清流。世業農。為人沉勇，喜遊俠。鄉里皆畏服。至正中，汀州府判蔡公安至清流募民兵討賊，友定應募。公安與語，奇之，使掌所募兵，署為黃土砦巡檢。以討平諸山寨功，遷清流縣尹。陳友諒遣其將鄧克明等陷汀、邵，略杉關。行省授友定汀州路總管禦之。戰于黃土，大捷，走克明。逾年，克明復取汀州，急攻建寧。守將完者帖木兒檄友定入援，連破賊，悉復所失郡縣。行省上其功第一，進參知政事。已，置分省于延平，以友定為平章，於是友定盡有福建八郡之地。

Chen Youding, also known as Youding, styled Anguo, was a native of Fuqing who later moved to Qingliu in Tingzhou. His family were farmers. He was brave and enjoyed chivalrous activities, earning the respect and fear of his fellow villagers. During the Zhizheng period, the Tingzhou Prefecture Judge Cai Gong'an came to Qingliu to recruit militia to fight bandits, and Youding volunteered. Gong'an, impressed by him, appointed him to command the recruited soldiers and made him the inspector of Huangtu Fort. For his achievements in pacifying various mountain strongholds, he was promoted to magistrate of Qingliu County. When Chen Youliang sent his generals Deng Keming and others to capture Tingzhou and Shaozhou, and raid Shanguan, the provincial government appointed Youding as the chief of Tingzhou to defend against them. He fought at Huangtu, achieving a great victory and driving away Keming. The following year, Keming recaptured Tingzhou and launched a fierce attack on Jianning. The defending general Wanzhe Temur summoned Youding for reinforcements, and he repeatedly defeated the bandits, recovering all the lost counties. The provincial government reported his achievements as the highest, promoting him to Deputy Governor. Later, a sub-provincial government was established in Yanping, and Youding was appointed Prime Minister, thus controlling all eight counties of Fujian.

友定以農家子起傭伍，目不知書。及據八郡，數招致文學知名士，如閩縣鄭定、廬州王翰之屬，留置幕下。粗涉文史，習為五字小詩，皆有意理。然頗任威福，所屬違令者輒承制誅竄不絕。漳州守將羅良不平，以書責之曰：「郡縣者，國家之土地。官司者，人主之臣役。而廥廩者，朝廷之外府也。今足下視郡縣如室家，驅官僚如圉僕，擅廥廩如私藏，名雖報國，實有鷹揚跋扈之心。不知足下欲為郭子儀乎，抑為曹孟德乎？」友定怒，竟以兵誅良。而福清宣慰使陳瑞孫、崇安令孔楷、建陽人詹翰拒友定不從，皆被殺。於是友定威震八閩，然事元未嘗失臣節。是時張士誠據浙西，方國珍據浙東，名為附元，歲漕粟大都輒不至。而友定歲輸粟數十萬石，海道遼遠，至者嘗十三四。順帝嘉之，下詔褒美。

Youding, rising from a farmer's son to a hired soldier, was illiterate. When he controlled the eight counties, he frequently invited renowned scholars and literati, such as Zheng Ding from Min County and Wang Han from Luzhou, to join his staff. He dabbled in literature and history, composing five-character poems with meaningful content. However, he was quite authoritarian, and those who disobeyed his orders were often executed or exiled. The garrison commander of Zhangzhou, Luo Liang, was dissatisfied and wrote to him, saying, "Counties are the land of the state. Officials are the servants of the ruler. The granaries are the external treasury of the court. Now you treat the counties as your household, drive officials like servants, and use the granaries as your private store. Though you claim to serve the state, you have the heart of a tyrant. Do you wish to be like Guo Ziyi or Cao Mengde?" Youding, enraged, executed Liang with his army. The Comfort Commissioner of Fuqing, Chen Ruisun, the magistrate of Chong'an, Kong Kai, and the Jianyang native Zhan Han, who refused to follow Youding, were all killed. Thus, Youding's power shook the eight counties of Fujian, yet he never lost his loyalty to the Yuan. At that time, Zhang Shicheng controlled Zhexi, and Fang Guozhen controlled Zhedong, nominally loyal to the Yuan, but the annual grain tribute to the capital often did not arrive. However, Youding annually transported hundreds of thousands of stone of grain, despite the long sea route, with about seventy to eighty percent reaching the capital. Emperor Shun praised him and issued an edict to commend him.

太祖既定婺州，與友定接境。友定侵處州。參政胡深擊走之，遂下浦城，克松溪，獲友定將張子玉，與硃亮祖進攻建寧，破其二柵。友定遣阮德柔以兵四萬屯錦江，繞出深後，斷其歸路，而自帥牙將賴政等以銳師搏戰，德柔自後夾擊。深兵敗，被執死。太祖既平方國珍，即發兵伐友定。將軍胡廷美、何文輝由江西趨杉關，湯和、廖永忠由明州海道取福州，李文忠由浦城取建寧，而別遣使至延平，招諭友定。友定置酒大會諸將及賓客，殺明使者，瀝其血酒甕中，與眾酌飲之。酒酣，誓於眾曰：「吾曹並受元厚恩，有不以死拒者，身磔，妻子戮。」遂往視福州，環城作壘。距壘五十步，輒築一台，嚴兵為拒守計。已而聞杉關破，急分軍為二，以一軍守福，而自帥一軍守延平，以相掎角。及湯和等舟師抵福之五虎門，平章曲出引兵逆戰敗，明兵緣南台蟻附登城。守將遁去，參政尹克仁、宣政使朵耳麻不屈死，僉院柏帖木兒積薪樓下，殺妻妾及二女，縱火自焚死。

After Taizu had pacified Wuzhou, he bordered Youding's territory. Youding invaded Chuzhou. Deputy Governor Hu Shen drove him away, then captured Pucheng and Songxi, capturing Youding's general Zhang Ziyu. Together with Zhu Liangzu, they attacked Jianning, breaking through two stockades. Youding sent Ruan Derou with 40,000 troops to garrison Jinjiang, flanking Shen and cutting off his retreat, while he personally led his elite troops with General Lai Zheng to attack. Derou attacked from the rear, and Shen's forces were defeated and captured. After pacifying Fang Guozhen, Taizu immediately sent troops to attack Youding. Generals Hu Tingmei and He Wenhui advanced from Jiangxi towards Shanguan, while Tang He and Liao Yongzhong took the sea route from Mingzhou to capture Fuzhou, and Li Wenzhong advanced from Pucheng to capture Jianning. Another envoy was sent to Yanping to persuade Youding. Youding held a grand banquet with his generals and guests, killed the Ming envoy, and poured his blood into a wine jar, drinking it with the others. Drunk, he swore to the crowd, "We have all received great favor from the Yuan. If anyone does not resist to the death, he will be dismembered, and his family executed." He then went to inspect Fuzhou, building fortifications around the city. Every fifty steps, he built a platform, stationing troops for defense. Upon hearing of the fall of Shanguan, he quickly divided his forces, leaving one army to defend Fuzhou while he personally led another to defend Yanping, creating a pincer movement. When Tang He and others' naval forces reached the Five Tiger Gate of Fuzhou, Prime Minister Qu Chu led troops to meet them but was defeated. Ming forces climbed the southern platform and scaled the city walls. The defending general fled, and Deputy Governor Yin Keren and Commissioner Duo'erma died resisting. Inspector Bai Temur piled firewood under a building, killed his wife, concubines, and two daughters, and set the fire, burning himself to death.

廷美克建甯，湯和進攻延平。友定欲以持久困之，諸將請出戰，不許。數請不已，友定疑所部將叛，殺蕭院判。軍士多出降者。會軍器局災，城中礮聲震地，明師知有變，急攻城。友定呼其屬訣曰：「大事已去，吾一死報國，諸君努力。」因退入省堂，衣冠北面再拜，仰藥死。所部爭開城門納明師。師入，趨視之，猶未絕也。舁出水東門，適天大雷雨，友定復蘇。械送京師。入見，帝詰之。友定曆聲曰：「國破家亡，死耳，尚何言。」遂並其子海殺之。

Tingmei captured Jianning, and Tang He advanced to attack Yanping. Youding intended to hold out for a prolonged siege, but his generals repeatedly requested to engage in battle, which he refused. After numerous requests, Youding suspected his generals of plotting rebellion and killed Inspector Xiao. Many soldiers defected. When the armory caught fire, the sound of explosions shook the city, and the Ming forces, sensing a change, launched an urgent attack. Youding called his subordinates to bid farewell, saying, "The great cause is lost. I will die to repay the country. You all must strive hard." He then retreated to the provincial hall, dressed in official robes, bowed twice to the north, and took poison. His subordinates scrambled to open the city gates to let the Ming forces in. The Ming forces entered and found him still alive. They carried him out through the East Water Gate, where a sudden thunderstorm revived him. He was shackled and sent to the capital. When he was brought before the emperor, he was interrogated. Youding loudly declared, "The country is destroyed, and my family is gone. Death is all that remains. What more is there to say?" He and his son Hai were then executed.

海，一名宗海，工騎射，亦喜禮文士。友定既被執，自將樂歸於軍門，至是從死。

Hai, also known as Zonghai, was skilled in riding and archery and also appreciated scholars and literati. After Youding was captured, Hai returned from Jiangle to the military camp and was executed alongside his father.

元末所在盜起，民間起義兵保障鄉里，稱元帥者不可勝數，元輒因而官之。其後或去為盜，或事元不終，惟友定父子死義，時人稱完節焉。友定既死，興化、泉州皆望風納疑。獨漳州路達魯花赤迭裏彌實具公服，北面再拜，引斧斫印章，以佩刀剚喉而死。時雲「閩有三忠」，謂友定、柏帖木兒、迭裏彌實也。

At the end of the Yuan dynasty, bandits arose everywhere, and the people formed militias to protect their villages, with many calling themselves marshals. The Yuan often appointed them as officials. Later, some became bandits, and others did not remain loyal to the Yuan. Only Youding and his son died for their loyalty, and people of the time praised their integrity. After Youding's death, Xinghua and Quanzhou surrendered without resistance. Only the Darughachi of Zhangzhou, Dielimi Shi, donned official robes, bowed to the north, took an axe to his seal, and stabbed himself in the throat with his sword, dying. At that time, it was said that "Fujian has three loyalists," referring to Youding, Bai Temur, and Dielimi Shi.

鄭定，字孟宣。好擊劍，為友定記室。及敗，浮海入交、廣間。久之，還居長樂。洪武末，累官至國子助教。王翰，字用文，仕元為潮州路總管。友定敗，為黃冠，棲永泰山中者十載。太祖聞其賢，強起之，自刎死，有子偁知名。

Zheng Ding, styled Mengxuan, enjoyed sword fighting and served as Youding's secretary. After Youding's defeat, he fled across the sea to Jiaozhi and Guangxi. After a long time, he returned to live in Changle. By the end of the Hongwu period, he had risen to the position of Assistant Instructor at the National University. Wang Han, styled Yongwen, served the Yuan as the Chief of Chaozhou. After Youding's defeat, he became a Taoist priest and lived in seclusion in Yongtai Mountain for ten years. Taizu, hearing of his virtue, forcibly summoned him, and he committed suicide. He had a son named Cheng who became well-known.

為友定所辟者，又有伯顏子中。子中，其先西域人，後仕江西，因家焉。子中明《春秋》，五舉有司不第，行省辟授東湖書院山長，遷建昌教授。子中雖儒生，慷慨喜談兵。江西盜起，授分省都事，使守贛州，而陳友諒兵已破贛。子中倉卒募吏民，與鬥城下，不勝，脫身間道走閩。陳友定素知之，辟授行省員外郎。出奇計，以友定兵復建昌，浮海如元都獻捷。累遷吏部侍郎。持節發廣東何真兵救閩，至則真已降于廖永忠。子中跳墜馬，折一足，致軍前。永忠欲脅降之，不屈。永忠義而舍之。乃變姓名，冠黃冠，遊行江湖間。太祖求之不得，簿錄其妻子，子中竟不出。嘗齎鴆自隨，久之事浸解，乃還鄉里。洪武十二年詔郡縣舉元遺民。布政使沈立本密言子中於朝，以幣聘。使者至，子中太息曰：「死晚矣。」為歌七章，哭其祖父師友，飲鴆而死。

Another person recruited by Youding was Boyan Zizhong. Zizhong's ancestors were from the Western Regions, but he later served in Jiangxi and settled there. Zizhong was well-versed in the "Spring and Autumn Annals" and, after five unsuccessful attempts at the civil service exams, was appointed by the provincial government as the head of Donghu Academy and later as a professor in Jianchang. Although a scholar, Zizhong was passionate about discussing military affairs. When bandits arose in Jiangxi, he was appointed as a provincial official to defend Ganzhou, but Chen Youliang's forces had already captured it. In a hurry, he recruited officials and civilians to fight under the city walls but was unsuccessful and fled to Fujian. Youding, knowing him well, appointed him as an assistant official in the provincial government. Using clever strategies, he helped Youding's forces recapture Jianchang and sailed to the Yuan capital to report the victory. He was repeatedly promoted to Deputy Minister of Personnel. He was sent to Guangdong to recruit He Zhen's troops to aid Fujian, but by the time he arrived, He Zhen had already surrendered to Liao Yongzhong. Zizhong jumped off his horse, breaking a leg, and was brought before the army. Liao Yongzhong tried to coerce him into surrendering, but he refused. Liao Yongzhong, admiring his integrity, released him. He then changed his name, donned a Taoist robe, and wandered the rivers and lakes. Taizu sought him but could not find him, and his wife and children were registered. Zizhong never came forward. He always carried poison with him. After a long time, the situation eased, and he returned to his hometown. In the twelfth year of Hongwu, an edict was issued for counties to recommend former Yuan officials. Provincial Governor Shen Liben secretly reported Zizhong to the court and sent an envoy with gifts to invite him. When the envoy arrived, Zizhong sighed and said, "I have lived too long." He composed seven songs mourning his ancestors, teachers, and friends, and drank poison to die.

當元亡時，守土臣仗節死者甚眾。明兵克太平，總管靳義赴水死。攻集慶，行台御史大夫福壽戰敗，嬰城固守。城破，猶督兵巷戰，坐伏龜樓指揮。左右或勸之遁，福壽叱而射之，遂死於兵。參政伯家奴、達魯花赤達尼達思等皆戰死。克鎮江，守將段武、平章定定戰死。克甯國，百戶張文貴殺妻妾自刎死。克徽州，萬戶吳訥戰敗自殺。克婺州，浙東廉訪使楊惠、婺州達魯花赤僧住戰死。克衢州，總管馬浩赴水死。石抺宜孫守處州，其母與弟厚孫先為明兵所獲，令為書招之。不聽。比克處，宜孫戰敗，走建寧，收集士卒，欲復處州。攻慶元，為耿再成所敗，還走建寧。半道遇鄉兵，被殺，部將李彥文葬之龍泉。太祖嘉其忠，遣使致祭，復其處州生祠。又祠福壽于應天，余闕于安慶，李黼于江州。闕、黼事具《元史》。

When the Yuan dynasty fell, many local officials died defending their territories. When Ming forces captured Taiping, Governor Jin Yi drowned himself. During the attack on Jiqing, Grand Chancellor Fushou was defeated, but he fortified the city and continued to command the street battles from a turtle tower. His subordinates advised him to flee, but he scolded and shot at them, eventually dying in battle. Deputy Governor Bojianu, Darughachi Danidasi, and others also died in battle. When Zhenjiang was captured, Commander Duan Wu and Prime Minister Dingding died in battle. When Ningguo was captured, Centurion Zhang Wengui killed his wife and concubines and committed suicide. When Huizhou was captured, Commander Wu Ne was defeated and committed suicide. When Wuzhou was captured, Zhejiang Inspector Yang Hui and Wuzhou Darughachi Sengzhu died in battle. When Quzhou was captured, Governor Ma Hao drowned himself. Shimo Yisun defended Chuzhou, and his mother and brother Housun were first captured by Ming forces and ordered to write to him to surrender, but he refused. When Chuzhou was captured, Yisun was defeated and fled to Jianning, gathering soldiers to retake Chuzhou. He attacked Qingyuan but was defeated by Geng Zaicheng and fled back to Jianning. On the way, he encountered local soldiers and was killed. His general Li Yanwen buried him in Longquan. Taizu, admiring his loyalty, sent an envoy to offer sacrifices and restored his shrine in Chuzhou. He also enshrined Fushou in Yingtian, Yuque in Anqing, and Li Fu in Jiangzhou. The deeds of Yuque and Li Fu are detailed in the "History of Yuan."

其後大軍北克益都，平章普顏不花不屈死。克東昌，平章申榮自經死。真定路達魯花赤鈒納錫彰聞王師取元都，朝服登城西崖，北面再拜，投崖死。克奉元，西台御史桑哥失裏與妻子俱投崖死，左丞拜泰古逃入終南山，郎中王可仰藥死，檢校阿失不花自經死。三原縣尹硃春謂其妻曰：「吾當死以報國。」妻曰：「君能盡忠，妾豈不能盡節。」亦俱投繯死。又大軍攻永州，右丞鄧祖勝固守，食盡力窮，仰藥死。克梧州，吏部尚書普顏帖木兒戰死，張翱赴水死。克靖江，都事趙元隆、陳瑜、劉永錫，廉訪使僉事帖木兒不花，元帥元禿蠻，萬戶董醜漢，府判趙世傑皆自殺。至如劉福通、徐壽輝、陳友諒等所破郡縣，守吏將帥多死節者，已見《元史》，不具載，載其見《明實錄》者。

Later, when the main army captured Yidu in the north, Prime Minister Puyan Buhua died resisting. When Dongchang was captured, Prime Minister Shen Rong hanged himself. When Darughachi Sana Xizhang of Zhenning heard that the royal army had captured the Yuan capital, he donned his official robes, ascended the western cliff of the city, bowed to the north, and threw himself off the cliff to his death. When Fengyuan was captured, Western Court Censor Sanggeshili and his family all threw themselves off a cliff to their deaths. Left Chancellor Baitaigu fled into the Zhongnan Mountains, Court Gentleman Wang Ke took poison, and Inspector Ashibuhua hanged himself. The magistrate of Sanyuan County, Zhu Chun, said to his wife, "I must die to repay the country." His wife replied, "If you can be loyal, how can I not be chaste?" They both hanged themselves. When the main army attacked Yongzhou, Right Chancellor Deng Zusheng defended it, but when food ran out and strength was exhausted, he took poison and died. When Wuzhou was captured, Minister of Personnel Puyan Temur died in battle, and Zhang Ao drowned himself. When Jingjiang was captured, officials Zhao Yuanlong, Chen Yu, Liu Yongxi, Inspector Temur Buhua, Marshal Yuan Tuman, Centurion Dong Chouhan, and Prefect Zhao Shijie all committed suicide. As for the counties and cities captured by Liu Futong, Xu Shouhui, and Chen Youliang, many loyal officials and generals died for their cause, as recorded in the "History of Yuan." Those recorded in the "Ming Shilu" are not listed here.

又有劉諶，江西人，為仁壽教官。明玉珍入蜀，棄官隱瀘州。玉珍欲官之，不就。鳳山趙善璞隱深山，明玉珍聘為學士，亦不就。而張士誠破平江時，參軍楊椿挺身戰，刃交於胸，嗔目怒駡死，妻亦自經。士誠又以書幣征故左司員外郎楊乘於松江，乘具酒醴告祖禰，顧西日晴明，曰：「人生晚節，如是足矣。」夜分自經死。其親籓死事最烈者，有雲南梁王。

There was also Liu Chen, a native of Jiangxi, who served as an instructor in Renshou. When Ming Yuzhen entered Sichuan, Liu Chen abandoned his post and hid in Luzhou. Ming Yuzhen wanted to appoint him to an official position, but he refused. Zhao Shanpu of Fengshan hid deep in the mountains, and when Ming Yuzhen invited him to be a scholar, he also refused. When Zhang Shicheng captured Pingjiang, military advisor Yang Chun fought bravely, with blades crossing his chest, glaring and cursing until he died. His wife also hanged herself. Zhang Shicheng then sent gifts to recruit former Assistant Minister Yang Cheng in Songjiang. Yang Cheng prepared wine and food to offer to his ancestors, looked at the clear western sky, and said, "To live a virtuous life until old age is enough." He hanged himself that night. Among those who died most valiantly for their loyalty was the King of Liang in Yunnan.

把匝剌瓦爾密
梁王把匝剌瓦爾密，元世祖第五子雲南王忽哥赤之裔也。封梁王，仍鎮雲南。順帝之世，天下多故，雲南僻遠，王撫治有威惠。至正二十三年，明玉珍僭號於蜀，遣兵三道來攻，王走營金馬山。明年以大理兵迎戰，玉珍兵敗退。久之，順帝北去，大都不守，中國無元尺寸地，而王守雲南自若；歲遣使自塞外達元帝行在，執臣節如故。

King of Liang, Bazalawarmi, was a descendant of Kublai Khan's fifth son, King of Yunnan, Hugachi. He was conferred the title of King of Liang and continued to govern Yunnan. During Emperor Shun's reign, the world was in turmoil, but Yunnan, being remote, was well-governed by the king with both authority and kindness. In the twenty-third year of Zhizheng, Ming Yuzhen declared himself emperor in Sichuan and sent troops in three directions to attack. The king retreated to camp at Jinma Mountain. The following year, he led Dali troops to meet the enemy, and Ming Yuzhen's forces were defeated and retreated. After a long time, Emperor Shun fled north, the capital was lost, and the Yuan had no territory left in China. However, the king continued to govern Yunnan as before, sending envoys annually from beyond the pass to the Yuan emperor's court, maintaining his loyalty.

未幾，明師平四川，天下大定。太祖以雲南險僻，不欲用兵。明年正月，北平守將以所得王遣往漠北使者蘇成來獻，太祖乃命待制王禕齎詔偕成往招諭。王待禕以禮。會元嗣君遣使脫脫來征餉，脫脫疑王有他意，因脅以危語。王遂殺禕而以禮斂之。逾三年，太祖復遣湖廣參政吳雲偕大軍所獲雲南使臣鐵知院等往。知院以己奉使被執，誘雲改制書紿王。雲不從，被殺。王聞雲死，收其骨，送蜀給孤寺。

Not long after, the Ming army pacified Sichuan, and the world was largely settled. Taizu, considering Yunnan's remote and rugged terrain, did not wish to use force. In the first month of the following year, the governor of Beiping sent Su Cheng, an envoy captured from the king, to the northern desert. Taizu then ordered Wang Yi to carry an edict and accompany Su Cheng to persuade the king. The king treated Wang Yi with courtesy. At that time, the Yuan successor sent an envoy, Tuo Tuo, to collect tribute. Tuo Tuo suspected the king of harboring other intentions and threatened him with dangerous words. The king then killed Wang Yi and buried him with honors. Over three years later, Taizu sent Deputy Governor Wu Yun of Huguang with the captured Yunnan envoy Tie Zhiyuan and others. Tie Zhiyuan, having been captured while on a mission, tried to deceive the king with a forged letter, but Wu Yun refused and was killed. The king, upon hearing of Wu Yun's death, collected his bones and sent them to the Gegu Monastery in Sichuan.

太祖知王終不可以諭降，乃命傅友德為征南將軍，藍玉、沐英為副，帥師征之。洪武十四年十二月下普定。王遣司徒平章達裏麻率兵駐曲靖。沐英引軍疾趨，乘霧抵白石江。霧解，達裏麻望見大驚。友德等率兵進擊，達裏麻兵潰被擒。先是，王以女妻大理酋段得功，嘗倚其兵力，後以疑殺之，遂失大理援。至是達裏麻敗，失精甲十余萬。王知事不可為，走普寧州之忽納砦，焚其龍衣，驅妻子赴滇池死。遂與左丞達的、右丞驢兒夜入草舍，俱自經。太祖遷其家屬于耽羅。

Taizu, realizing that the king would never be persuaded to surrender, appointed Fu Youde as General of the Southern Campaign, with Lan Yu and Mu Ying as deputies, to lead the army against him. In December of the fourteenth year of Hongwu, they captured Puding. The king sent Chancellor Dali Ma to lead troops to garrison Qujing. Mu Ying led his army swiftly, reaching Baishi River under the cover of fog. When the fog lifted, Dali Ma was greatly alarmed. Fu Youde and others led their troops to attack, and Dali Ma's forces were defeated and captured. Previously, the king had married his daughter to the chieftain of Dali, Duan Degong, relying on his military support, but later killed him out of suspicion, losing Dali's aid. With Dali Ma's defeat, the king lost over 100,000 elite troops. Knowing the situation was hopeless, he fled to Huna Fort in Puning Prefecture, burned his dragon robes, and drove his wife and children into Dianchi Lake to drown. He then entered a grass hut with Left Chancellor Dadi and Right Chancellor Luer, and they all hanged themselves. Taizu relocated their families to Danluo.

贊曰：洪武九年，方穀珍死，宋濂奉敕撰墓碑，于一時群雄，皆直書其名，獨至察罕，曰齊國李忠襄王，順逆之理昭然可見矣。擴廓百戰不屈，欲繼先志，而齎恨以死。友定不作何真之偷生，梁王恥為納哈出之背國，要皆元之忠臣也。《詩》曰「其儀一兮，心如結兮」，《易》曰「苦節悔亡」，其伯顏子中、蔡子英之謂歟。嘗謂元歸塞外，一時從臣必有賦《式微》之章於沙漠之表者，惜其姓字湮沒，不得見於人間。然則若子英者，又豈非厚幸哉！

In the ninth year of Hongwu, when Fang Guozhen died, Song Lian was ordered to write his epitaph. Among the heroes of the time, he wrote their names directly, but when it came to Chahan, he referred to him as the Loyal and Honorable King of Qi, Li. The distinction between loyalty and rebellion was clearly evident. Kuo Kuo, undefeated in a hundred battles, sought to continue his predecessor's ambitions but died with regret. Youding did not live a life of ignominy like He Zhen, and the King of Liang was ashamed to betray his country like Naha Chu. They were all loyal ministers of the Yuan. The "Book of Songs" says, "His demeanor is one, his heart is steadfast," and the "Book of Changes" says, "Bitter integrity, regret vanishes." This describes Boyan Zizhong and Cai Ziying. It is said that when the Yuan retreated beyond the pass, there must have been ministers who composed "Shih Wei" in the desert, but their names have been lost to history. Thus, someone like Ziying is indeed fortunate!
