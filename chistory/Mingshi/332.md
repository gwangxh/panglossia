撒馬兒罕

Samarkand

撒馬兒罕，即漢罽賓地，隋曰漕國，唐復名罽賓，皆通中國。

Samarkand, originally the territory of Han Jibin, was called Cao during the Sui dynasty and later renamed Jibin during the Tang dynasty, maintaining communication with China.

元太祖蕩平西域，盡以諸王、駙馬為之君長，易前代國名以蒙古語，始有撒馬兒罕之名。

Genghis Khan pacified the Western Regions, appointing princes and imperial sons-in-law as rulers, changing the names of previous states to Mongolian, thus Samarkand got its name.

去嘉峪關九千六百里。元末為之王者，駙馬帖木兒也。

It is 9,600 li away from Jiayuguan. At the end of the Yuan dynasty, the prince was the imperial son-in-law Temür.

洪武中，太祖欲通西域，屢遣使招諭，而遐方君長未有至者。

During the Hongwu era, Emperor Taizu sought to communicate with the Western Regions and repeatedly sent envoys, but no distant rulers responded.

二十年九月，帖木兒首遣回回滿剌哈非思等來朝，貢馬十五，駝二。

In the 20th year of Hongwu, in September, Temür first sent the Hui people Manlaha Feisi and others to court, offering fifteen horses and two camels.

詔宴其使，賜白金十有八錠。

The emperor hosted a banquet for the envoys and bestowed upon them eighteen silver ingots.

自是頻歲貢馬駝。二十五年兼貢絨六匹，青梭幅九匹，紅綠撒哈剌各二匹及鑌鐵刀劍、甲胄諸物。

From then on, horses and camels were frequently tributed. In the 25th year, they also offered six rolls of wool, nine blue silk fabrics, two rolls each of red and green silk, iron swords, armor, and other items.

而其國中回回又自驅馬抵涼州互市。帝不許，令赴京鬻之。

Additionally, Hui people from their country drove horses to Liangzhou for trade, which the emperor did not permit, instructing them to go to the capital to sell instead.

元時回回遍天下，及是居甘肅者尚多，詔守臣悉遣之，於是歸撒馬兒罕者千二百餘人。

During the Yuan dynasty, Hui people were widespread. By this time, many lived in Gansu. The emperor ordered officials to send them back, resulting in over 1,200 people returning to Samarkand.

二十七年八月，帖木兒貢馬二百。

In the 27th year, in August, Temür tributed two hundred horses.

其表曰：「恭惟大明大皇帝受天明命，統一四海，仁德洪布，恩養庶類，萬國欣仰。

In his memorial, he stated: "Respectfully, the great Emperor of the Ming dynasty received the heavenly mandate, unifying the four seas, spreading benevolence, nurturing all beings, admired by all nations."

咸知上天欲平治天下，特命皇帝出膺運數，為億兆之主。

"All know that heaven desires to bring peace and order to the world and has specially appointed the Emperor to bear this fate and rule over the multitude."

光明廣大，昭若天鏡，無有遠近，鹹照臨之。

"His brilliance is vast and expansive, as clear as the heavenly mirror, shining upon all regardless of distance."

臣帖木兒僻在萬里之外，恭聞聖德寬大，超越萬古。

"I, Temür, living in a remote area tens of thousands of miles away, humbly hear of the Emperor's broad and eternal virtues."

自古所無之福，皇帝皆有之。所未服之國，皇帝皆服之。

"The blessings the Emperor has are unprecedented, and the countries not yet subdued are all subdued by the Emperor."

遠方絕域，昏昧之地，皆清明之。

"Distant and remote, dark and obscure lands all become clear and bright."

老者無不安樂，少者無不長遂，善者無不蒙福，惡者無不知懼。

"The elderly live in peace and joy, the young grow and achieve, the virtuous are blessed, and the wicked are in fear."

今又特蒙施恩遠國，凡商賈之來中國者，使觀覽都邑、城池，富貴雄壯，如出昏暗之中，忽睹天日，何幸如之！

"Now, being specially graced with favor from afar, all merchants coming to China can see the capital and cities, their wealth and grandeur, as if emerging from darkness into the light of day, what fortune is like this!"

又承敕書恩撫勞問，使站驛相通，道路無壅，遠國之人鹹得其濟。

"Moreover, receiving imperial edicts of care and inquiry, the postal stations are connected, and the roads are unobstructed, allowing people from distant lands to benefit."

欽仰聖心，如照世之杯，使臣心中豁然光明。

"Respectfully admiring the Emperor's heart, like a cup illuminating the world, making the minister's heart clear and bright."

臣國中部落，聞茲德音，歡舞感戴。

"The tribes in my country, hearing of this virtue, dance in joy and gratitude."

臣無以報恩，惟仰天祝頌聖壽福祿，如天地永永無極。」

"I have no way to repay this grace, only looking up to heaven and praying for the Emperor's longevity, blessings, and prosperity, as everlasting as heaven and earth."

照世杯者，其國舊傳有杯光明洞徹，照之可知世事，故云。

As for the illuminating cup, it is an ancient legend in his country that there is a cup whose light penetrates deeply, revealing worldly matters, hence the saying.

帝得表，嘉其有文。明年命給事中傅安等齎璽書、幣帛報之。

The Emperor, upon receiving the memorial, praised its eloquence. The following year, he ordered Geishizhong Fu An and others to carry an imperial edict and silk to respond.

其貢馬，一歲再至，以千計，並賜賓鈔償之。

Their tributed horses arrived twice a year, totaling in the thousands, and they were rewarded with paper money.

成祖踐阼，遣使敕諭其國。永樂三年，傅安等尚未還，而朝廷聞帖木兒假道別失八里率兵東，敕甘肅總兵官宋晟儆備。

When Emperor Chengzu ascended the throne, he sent envoys to instruct their country. In the third year of Yongle, Fu An and others had not yet returned, and the court heard that Temür was leading his army east through Bieshibali. The emperor ordered Song Sheng, the general of Gansu, to prepare for defense.

五年六月，安等還。初，安至其國被留，朝貢亦絕。

In the fifth year, in June, Fu An and others returned. Initially, upon reaching their country, they were detained, halting the tribute.

尋令人導安遍曆諸國數萬里，以誇其國廣大。

They had someone guide Fu An around various countries for tens of thousands of miles to boast about their vastness.

至是帖木兒死，其孫哈裏嗣，乃遣使臣虎歹達等送安還，貢方物。

By this time, Temür had died, and his grandson Hari succeeded him. He sent the envoy Hudada and others to escort Fu An back and tribute local products.

帝厚賚其使，遣指揮白阿兒忻台等往祭故王，而賜新王及部落銀幣。

The Emperor generously rewarded their envoys, sent Commander Bai Arhintai and others to offer sacrifices to the late king, and bestowed silver coins to the new king and tribes.

Their leader Sharunuddin and others also tributed camels and horses. The emperor ordered Fu An and others to bestow colorful coins to their king and accompany the tribute envoys.

七年，安等還，王遣使隨入貢。自後，或比年，或間

一歲，或三歲，輒入貢。

In the seventh year, Fu An and others returned, and the king sent envoys to tribute. Thereafter, tributes were sent either annually, biennially, or triennially.

In the thirteenth year, envoys were sent with Li Da, Chen Cheng, and others to tribute.

In the tenth year, in October, the emperor wrote to their king Ulugbek Qulig Khan, saying: "The king, residing far in the western frontier, diligently fulfills tribute duties, which is commendable."

使回，特賜王及王妻子彩幣表裏，示朕優待之意。」

"Upon the envoy's return, I specially bestow colorful coins to the king and his wife and children, showing my intention of special treatment."

別敕賜金玉器、龍首杖、細馬鞍及諸色織金文綺，官其使臣為指揮僉事。

"Separately, I bestow gold and jade items, dragon-head staffs, fine horse saddles, and various brocade fabrics, and appoint their envoys as assistant commanders."

景泰七年貢馬駝、玉石。

In the seventh year of Jingtai, they tributed horses, camels, and jade.

禮官言：「舊制給賞太重。今正、副使應給一等、二等賞物者，如舊時。

The ritual officials said: "The previous system of rewards was too heavy. Now the primary and secondary envoys should receive first-class and second-class rewards, as in the past."

三等人給彩緞四表裏，絹三匹，織金糸寧絲衣一襲。

"Third-class people should be given four pieces of colorful satin, three bolts of silk, and one gold-threaded silk garment."

其隨行鎮撫、舍人以下，遞減有差。

"The accompanying attendants and those below them should receive proportionally reduced rewards."

所進阿魯骨馬每匹彩緞四表裏、絹八匹，駝三表裏、絹十匹，達達馬不分等第，每匹糸寧絲一匹、絹八匹、折鈔絹一匹，中等馬如之，下等者亦遞減有差。」

"Each tribute Aru bone horse should be rewarded with four pieces of colorful satin, eight bolts of silk, three pieces of colorful satin for camels, ten bolts of silk, Dada horses, regardless of rank, each with one bolt of silk thread, eight bolts of silk, and one bolt of paper silk. Medium and lower quality horses should also receive proportionally reduced rewards."

制可。

The system was approved.

又言：「所貢玉石，堪用者止二十四塊，六十八斤，餘五千九百餘斤不適於用，宜令自鬻。而彼堅欲進獻，請每五斤賜絹一匹。」亦可之。

They also said: "Among the tributed jade, only twenty-four pieces, weighing sixty-eight jin, are usable. The remaining 5,900 jin are unsuitable for use and should be sold by themselves. However, since they insist on presenting them, please reward one bolt of silk for every five jin." This was also approved.

已而使臣還，賜王卜撒因文綺、器物。

Afterward, the envoys returned, and the king, Buzayin, was rewarded with brocade and utensils.

天順元年命都指揮馬雲等使西域，敕獎其鎖魯檀毋撒，賜彩幣，令護朝使往還。

In the first year of Tianshun, the commander Ma Yun and others were sent to the Western Regions, with an edict praising their ruler, Musa, bestowing colorful coins, and ordering the protection of envoys to and from the court.

鎖魯檀者，君長之稱，猶蒙古可汗也。七年復命指揮詹升等使其國。

"Sultan" is their term for ruler, akin to the Mongol Khan. In the seventh year, commander Zhan Sheng and others were sent to their country.

十九年偕亦思罕酋長貢二獅，至肅州，其使者奏請大臣往迎。

In the nineteenth year, he, along with the chieftain of Yishihan, tributed two lions. Upon reaching Suzhou, their envoys requested a minister to greet them.

職方郎中陸容言：「此無用之物，在郊廟不可為犧牲，在乘輿不可被驂服，宜勿受。」

The official Lu Rong said: "These useless items cannot be used as sacrifices in suburban temples, nor can they be harnessed to chariots. It is better not to accept them."

禮官周洪謨等亦言往迎非禮，帝卒遣中使迎之。

Ritual officials like Zhou Hongmo also said that greeting them was not proper etiquette, but the emperor ultimately sent eunuchs to greet them.

獅日啖生羊二，醋、酐、蜜酪各二瓶。

The lions ate two live sheep daily, along with two bottles each of vinegar, curd, and honey cheese.

養獅者，光祿日給酒饌。

Those who raised the lions were provided with wine and food daily by the Imperial Household.

帝既厚加賜賚，而其使者怕六灣以為輕，援永樂間例為請。

The emperor generously rewarded them, but their envoy Pa Liuwan considered it insufficient and cited precedents from the Yongle era to request more.

禮官議從正統四年例，加彩幣五表裏。

The ritual officials proposed following the example of the fourth year of Zhengtong, adding five pieces of colorful coins.

使者復以為輕，乃加正、副使各二表裏，從者半之，命中官韋洛、鴻臚署丞海濱送之還。

The envoy still considered it insufficient, so the main and secondary envoys were each given two more pieces of colorful coins, and the attendants half that amount. Eunuch Wei Luo and Honglu Shucheng Haibin were ordered to escort them back.

其使者不由故道赴廣東，又多買良家女為妻妾，洛等不為禁止。

Their envoys did not take the usual route to Guangdong and also bought many girls from good families to be wives and concubines, which Wei Luo and others did not prevent.

久之，洛上疏委罪於濱，濱坐下吏。

After a long time, Wei Luo submitted a memorial blaming Haibin, and Haibin was demoted to a lower official.

其使者請泛海至滿剌加市狻猊以獻，市舶中官韋眷主之，布政使陳選力陳不可，乃已。

Their envoys requested to sail to Malacca to trade for lions to present as gifts. The Maritime Superintendent Wei Juan supported this, but the Minister of Revenue Chen Xuan strongly opposed it, so the idea was dropped.

弘治二年，其使由滿剌加至廣東，貢獅子、鸚鵡諸物，守臣以聞。

In the second year of Hongzhi, their envoys came from Malacca to Guangdong, tributing lions, parrots, and other items, which was reported by the local officials.

禮官耿裕等言：「南海非西域貢道，請卻之。」

The ritual official Geng Yu and others said: "The South Sea is not the tribute route of the Western Regions. Please reject it."

禮科給事中韓鼎等亦言：「猙獰之獸，狎玩非宜，且騷擾道路，供費不貲，不可受。」

The ritual department's Censor Han Ding and others also said: "Fierce animals are not suitable for play, and they disturb the roads and incur excessive costs, so they should not be accepted."

帝曰：「珍禽奇獸，朕不受獻，況來非正道，其即卻還。

The emperor said: "Rare birds and strange beasts, I do not accept as gifts, and moreover, since they did not come via the proper route, they should be returned."

守臣違制宜罪，姑貸之。」

"The officials who violated the regulations should be punished,

 but I will temporarily pardon them."

禮官又言：「海道固不可開，然不宜絕之已甚，請薄犒其使，量以綺帛賜其王。」制可。

The ritual officials further said: "The maritime route should indeed not be opened, but it should not be completely cut off. Please reward their envoys modestly and bestow silk fabrics to their king." This was approved.

明年又偕土魯番貢獅子及哈剌、虎剌諸獸，由甘肅入。

The following year, they again accompanied the envoys from Turfan, tributing lions and other beasts such as leopards and tigers, entering through Gansu.

鎮守中官傅德、總兵官周玉等先圖形奏聞，即遣人馳驛起送。

The eunuch in charge, Fu De, and the general, Zhou Yu, first drew their forms and reported them, then immediately dispatched people to send them by courier.

獨巡按御史陳瑤論其糜費煩擾，請勿納。

Only the Inspecting Censor Chen Yao argued about the excessive costs and disturbances and requested not to accept them.

禮官議如其言，量給犒賞，且言：「聖明在禦，屢卻貢獻，德等不能奉行德意，請罪之。」

The ritual officials agreed with him, giving limited rewards, and also said: "The wise and enlightened emperor frequently rejects tributes, but Fu De and others failed to follow the emperor's intention. Please punish them."

帝曰：「貢使既至，不必卻回，可但遣一二人詣京。

The emperor said: "Since the tribute envoys have already arrived, there is no need to send them back. Just send one or two people to the capital."

獅子諸物，每獸日給一羊，不得妄費。德等貸勿治。」

"For lions and other beasts, provide one sheep per animal per day, and do not waste resources arbitrarily. Pardon Fu De and others from punishment."

後至十二年始來貢。

Later, in the twelfth year, they began tributing again.

明年復至。而正德中猶數至。

The following year, they came again. During the Zhengde era, they frequently tributed.

嘉靖二年，貢使又至。

In the second year of Jiajing, the tribute envoys arrived again.

禮官言：「諸國使臣在途者遷延隔歲，在京者伺候同賞，光祿、郵傳供費不貲，宜示以期約。」

The ritual officials said: "The envoys from various countries delay on the road, sometimes taking more than a year. Those in the capital wait for the same rewards, and the expenses for the Imperial Household and postal services are excessive. It is advisable to set a time limit."

因列上禁制數事，從之。

They listed several prohibitions, which were approved.

十二年偕天方、土魯番入貢，稱王者至百餘人。

In the twelfth year, they, along with Tianfang and Turfan, came to tribute, with over a hundred people claiming to be kings.

禮官夏言等論其非，請敕閣臣議所答。

The ritual officials, led by Xia Yan, argued against this and requested the cabinet ministers to discuss the response.

張孚敬等言：「西域諸王，疑出本國封授，或部落自相尊稱。

Zhang Fujing and others said: "The various kings of the Western Regions might be appointed within their own countries or self-proclaimed by their tribes."

先年亦有至三四十人者，即據所稱答之。

"In previous years, there were also cases of thirty or forty people coming, and we responded according to their claims."

若驟議裁革，恐人情觖望，乞更敕禮、兵二部詳議。」

"If we suddenly propose to reduce or abolish this, it might cause dissatisfaction. We request further discussion with the ritual and military departments."

於是言及樞臣王憲等謂：「西域稱王者，止土魯番、天方、撒馬兒罕。

Regarding this, the Privy Minister Wang Xian and others said: "Among the Western Regions, only Turfan, Tianfang, and Samarkand are considered to have legitimate kings."

如日落諸國，稱名雖多，朝貢絕少。

"For countries like Riluo, although many claim the title of king, very few actually pay tribute."

弘、正間，土魯番十三入貢，正德間，天方四入貢，稱王者率一人，多不過三人，餘但稱頭目而已。

"During the Hongzhi and Zhengde eras, Turfan tributed thirteen times, and Tianfang four times, with usually one person claiming to be king, at most three. The rest only claimed to be leaders."

至嘉靖二年、八年，天方多至六七人，土魯番至十一二人，撒馬兒罕至二十七人。

"By the second and eighth years of Jiajing, Tianfang had six or seven people, Turfan eleven or twelve, and Samarkand twenty-seven people."

孚敬等言三四十人者，並數三國爾。

"When Zhang Fujing and others mentioned thirty or forty people, they included all three countries."

今土魯番十五王，天方二十七王，撒馬兒罕五十三王，實前此所未有。

"Now, Turfan has fifteen kings, Tianfang twenty-seven kings, and Samarkand fifty-three kings, which is unprecedented."

弘治時回賜敕書，止稱一王。

"During the Hongzhi era, when giving edicts, we only recognized one king."

若循撒馬兒罕往歲故事，類答王號，人與一敕，非所以尊中國制外蕃也。

"If we follow the old precedent of Samarkand and give an edict to each person claiming to be king, it does not respect China's principle of controlling foreign tribes."

蓋帝王之馭外蕃，固不拒其來，亦必限以制，其或名號僭差，言詞侮慢，則必正以大義，責其無禮。

"When emperors govern foreign tribes, they do not refuse their visits, but they must set limits. If titles are usurped or words are disrespectful, they must be corrected with righteousness and held accountable for their rudeness."

今謂本國所封，何以不見故牘？

"Now, if they claim to be appointed by their own countries, why are there no previous records?"

謂部落自號，何以達之天朝？

"If they claim titles by themselves, how do they convey this to the imperial court?"

我概給以敕，而彼即據敕恣意往來，恐益擾郵傳，費供億，殫府庫以實溪壑，非計之得也。」

"If we indiscriminately give edicts, and they use them to come and go as they please, it will further burden the postal services, incur enormous costs, and drain the treasury, which is not a wise policy."

帝納其言，國止給一敕，且加詰讓，示以國無二王之義。

The emperor accepted their advice, giving only one edict per country, with additional reprimands, indicating that a country cannot have two kings.

然諸蕃迄不從，十五年入貢復如故。

However, the various tribes did not comply, and in the fifteenth year, they tributed as before.

甘肅巡撫趙載奏：「諸國稱王者至一百五十餘人，皆非本朝封爵，宜令改正，且定貢使名數。

The Gansu governor Zhao Zai reported: "Over 150 people claiming to be kings from various countries have not been officially appointed by our court. It is appropriate to rectify this and set limits on the number of tribute envoys."

通事宜用漢人，毋專用色目人，致交通生釁。」部議從之。

"Interpreters should be Han Chinese, not exclusively Seme people, to avoid causing conflicts." The ministry agreed.

二十六年入貢，甘肅巡撫楊博請重定朝貢事宜，禮官復列數事行之。

In the twenty-sixth year, when tributing, the Gansu governor Yang Bo requested to redefine tribute matters, and the ritual officials listed several actions to be implemented.

後入貢，迄萬曆中不絕。

Later tributes continued until the Wanli era without

 interruption.

蓋番人善賈，貪中華互市，既入境，則一切飲食、道途之資，皆取之有司，雖定五年一貢，迄不肯遵，天朝亦莫能難也。

Foreigners are good merchants and covet Chinese markets. Once they enter the territory, all food and travel expenses are provided by local officials. Even though a five-year tribute interval was set, they did not comply, and the imperial court could not enforce it.

"Although separated by mountains and seas, with different customs and habits, the feelings of love and hatred and the nature of blood and spirit are never different."

皇天眷佑，惟一視之。

"Heavenly care is the same for all."

故受天命為天下主者，上奉天道，一視同仁，俾巨細諸國，殊方異類之君民，鹹躋乎仁壽。

特遣官勞嘉，其悉朕意。」

"I specifically sent officials to commend and reward, to convey my intentions."

When Kuanche and his companions arrived, the king, dissatisfied with the lack of generous gifts, detained them. Only Han Jing and Tang Zheng were able to return.

In the thirtieth year, in January, the emperor again sent officials with a letter saying: "Since my ascension, Western merchants coming to China for trade have never been obstructed by border generals."

朕復敕吏民善遇之，由是商人獲利，疆埸無擾，是我中華大有惠于爾國也。

"I have also instructed officials and civilians to treat them well, thus merchants have profited, and the borders have remained undisturbed. This demonstrates that China has greatly benefited your country."

前遣寬徹等往爾諸國通好，何故至今不返？

"Previously, I sent Kuanche and others to your countries to establish good relations. Why have they not yet returned?"

吾于諸國，未嘗拘留一人，而爾顧拘留吾使，豈理也哉！

"I have never detained anyone from your countries, yet you have detained my envoys. How is this reasonable?"

是以近年回回入境者，亦令於中國互市，待徹歸放還。

"Therefore, in recent years, I have allowed Hui people entering the territory to trade in China, awaiting Kuanche's release."

後諸人言有父母妻子，吾念其至情，悉縱遣之。

"Later, these people said they had parents and families, and I, considering their deep feelings, released them all."

今復使使諭爾，俾知朝廷恩意，毋梗塞道路，致啟兵端。《書》曰：『怨不在大，亦不在小。惠不惠，懋不懋。』爾其惠且懋哉。」

"Now, I send envoys to inform you, so you understand the court's kindness. Do not block the roads and cause conflict. The 'Book of Documents' says: 'Resentment does not lie in greatness or smallness. Kindness must be reciprocated.' You should be kind and diligent."

and, and other countries, with thirty-seven kings claiming titles.

 禮官言：「舊制，恰哈密與朵顏三衛比歲一貢，貢不過三百人。三衛地近，盡許入都。哈密則十遣其二，余留待于邊。若西域則越在萬里，素非屬國，難視三衛貢期，而所遣使人倍逾恒數。番文至二百餘通，皆以索取叛人牙木蘭為詞。竊恐托詞窺伺，以覘朝廷處分。邊臣不遵明例，概行起送，有乖法體。乞下督撫諸臣，遇諸番人入貢，分別存留起送，不得概遣入京。且嚴飭邊吏，毋避禍目前，貽患異日，貪納款之虛名，忘禦邊之實策。」帝可其奏。

The ritual officer said, "According to old regulations, Hami and the three garrison areas of Duoyan contributed tributes once every few years, with no more than three hundred people allowed for the tribute. The three garrison areas are nearby and are permitted to enter the capital. Hami sends two out of every ten, with the rest staying at the border. As for the Western Regions, which are over ten thousand miles away and have never been vassal states, it is difficult to compare their tribute terms to those of the three garrison areas. The number of envoys sent has far exceeded the usual number. We have received more than two hundred communications, all demanding the return of the rebel Yamulian. We fear this is a pretext to spy on the court’s decisions. The border officials, not adhering to clear regulations, are sending them off indiscriminately, which is against proper protocol. We request that the governor and ministers be ordered to differentiate between those who should stay and those who should be sent back, and not allow all to enter the capital indiscriminately. Furthermore, border officials should be strictly ordered not to avoid immediate trouble at the cost of future problems, seeking the false reputation of receiving gifts while neglecting the real strategy of guarding the border." The emperor approved this petition.

 故事，諸番貢物至，邊臣驗上其籍，禮官為按籍給賜。籍所不載，許自行貿易。貢使既竣，即有餘貨，責令攜歸。願入官者，禮官奏聞，給鈔。正德末，黠番猾胥交關罔利，始有貿易余貨令市儈評直、官給絹鈔之例。至是，天方及土魯番使臣，其籍余玉石、銼刀諸貨，固求准貢物給賞。禮官不得已，以正德間例為請，許之。

In the past, when the tributes from various foreign lands arrived, the border officials would verify and record them, and the ritual officers would grant rewards based on the records. Items not listed in the records were allowed to be traded privately. Once the tribute mission was completed, any surplus goods were required to be taken back. If they wished to offer these items to the government, the ritual officers would report and provide paper money in exchange. At the end of the Zhengde period, cunning foreign merchants and local clerks colluded for profit, initiating a practice where surplus goods were assessed by market brokers and compensated with government-issued silk or paper money. At this time, envoys from Tianfang (Arabia) and Turfan sought rewards for surplus goods such as jade and files. The ritual officers, unable to refuse, requested permission based on the Zhengde period precedent, and it was granted.

 番使多賈人，來輒挾重貲與中國市。邊吏嗜賄，侵克多端，類取償於公家。或不當其直，則咆哮不止。是歲，貢使皆黠悍，既習知中國情，且憾邊吏之侵克也，屢訴之，禮官卻不問。鎮守甘肅中官陳浩者，當番使入貢時，令家奴王洪多索名馬、玉石諸物，使臣憾之。一日，遇洪於衢，即執詣官以證實其事。禮官言事關國體，須大有處分，以服遠人之心。乃命三法司、錦衣衛及給事中各遣官一員赴甘肅按治，洪迄獲罪。

Many of the foreign envoys were merchants who came with substantial wealth to trade with China. Border officials, who were greedy for bribes, employed various methods of extortion, often compensating themselves from public funds. When not given their due, the foreign envoys would make a great clamor. That year, the envoys were particularly cunning and aggressive, familiar with Chinese customs and resentful of the extortion by border officials, frequently lodging complaints which the ritual officers ignored. Chen Hao, a central official in charge of Gansu, had his household slave Wang Hong extort famous horses and jade from the envoys during their tribute missions, causing resentment among them. One day, encountering Wang Hong on the street, they seized him and took him to an official to substantiate their accusations. The ritual officers stated that the matter concerned national dignity and required serious action to earn the respect of distant peoples. Consequently, officers from the three judicial authorities, the Embroidered Uniform Guard, and the Censorate were dispatched to Gansu to investigate, and Wang Hong was ultimately punished.

 十七年復貢，其使臣請遊覽中土。禮官疑有狡心，以非故事格之。二十二年偕撒馬兒罕、土魯番、哈密、魯迷諸國貢馬及方物。後五六年一貢，迄萬曆中不絕。

In the seventeenth year, a tribute was again sent, and the envoys requested to tour China. The ritual officers, suspecting deceitful intentions, rejected the request as it was not customary. In the twenty-second year, envoys from Samarkand, Turfan, Hami, and Rumie brought horses and other items as tribute. Subsequently, tributes were sent once every five or six years, continuing unbroken into the Wanli period.

 天方於西域為大國，四時常似夏，無雨雹霜雪，惟露最濃，草木皆資之長養。土沃，饒栗、麥、黑黍。人皆頎碩。男子削髮，以布纏之。婦女則編發蓋頭，不露其面。相傳回回設教之祖曰馬哈麻者，首於此地行教，死即葬焉。墓頂常有光，日夜不熄。後人遵其教，久而不衰，故人皆向善。國無苛擾，亦無刑罰，上下安和，寇賊不作，西土稱為樂國。俗禁酒。有禮拜寺，月初生，其王及臣民鹹拜天，號呼稱揚以為禮。寺分四方，每方九十間，共三百六十間，皆白玉為柱，黃甘玉為地。其堂以五色石砌成，四方平頂。內用沉香大木為梁凡五，又以黃金為閣。堂中垣墉，悉以薔薇露、龍涎香和土為之。守門以二黑獅。堂左有司馬儀墓，其國稱為聖人塚。土悉寶石，圍牆則黃甘玉。兩旁有諸祖師傳法之堂，亦以石築成，俱極其壯麗。其崇奉回回教如此。

Tianfang (Arabia) is a major country in the Western Regions, with weather resembling summer all year round, without rain, hail, frost, or snow, only with heavy dew nurturing the growth of vegetation. The soil is fertile, abundant with chestnuts, wheat, and black millet. The people are tall and robust. Men shave their heads and wrap them with cloth, while women braid their hair, cover their heads, and do not reveal their faces. It is said that the founder of the Huihui (Muslim) religion, named Mahama, first preached in this place and was buried there after his death. His tomb is always illuminated, never extinguished day or night. Followers have long adhered to his teachings, fostering a culture of goodness. The country is free from tyranny and punishment, with peace and harmony prevailing, and no occurrences of banditry. The Western Regions refer to it as the "Country of Joy." Alcohol is prohibited by custom. There is a prayer hall where, at the beginning of each month, the king and his subjects all pray to the heavens, calling out praises as a ritual. The hall is divided into four sections,

 each with ninety rooms, totaling three hundred and sixty rooms, with white jade pillars and yellow jade floors. The main hall is built with five-colored stones and has a flat roof. Inside, five large agarwood beams support the structure, adorned with golden pavilions. The walls are made of a mixture of rose dew and dragon's saliva incense with soil. Two black lions guard the entrance. To the left of the hall is the tomb of Simayi, regarded by the country as the tomb of a saint. The tomb is made entirely of precious stones, with the surrounding walls of yellow jade. On both sides are halls for the ancestral masters who transmitted the teachings, also built of stone, all extremely magnificent. Such is their veneration of the Huihui religion.

 瓜果、諸畜，鹹如中國。西瓜、甘瓜有一人不能舉者，桃有重四五斤者，雞、鴨有重十餘斤者，皆諸番所無也。馬哈麻墓後有一井，水清而甘。泛海者必汲以行，遇颶風，取水灑之即息。當鄭和使西洋時，傳其風物如此。其後稱王者至二三十人，其俗亦漸不如初矣。

Their melons, fruits, and various livestock are similar to those in China. There are watermelons and sweet melons that one person cannot lift, peaches weighing four or five jin, and chickens and ducks weighing more than ten jin, none of which are found in other foreign lands. Behind Mahama's tomb is a well with clear and sweet water. Sailors always draw water from it before their voyages, and when encountering typhoons, they sprinkle the water to calm the storm. During Zheng He's voyages to the Western Oceans, such customs were reported. Since then, there have been twenty to thirty rulers, and their customs have gradually declined from their original state.

 默德那
默德那，回回祖國也，地近天方。宣德時，其酋長遣使偕天方使臣來貢，後不復至。相傳，其初國王謨罕驀德生而神靈，盡臣服西域諸國，諸國尊為別諳拔爾，猶言天使也。國中有經三十本，凡三千六百余段。其書旁行，兼篆、草、楷三體，西洋諸國皆用之。其教以事天為主，而無像設。每日西向虔拜。每歲齋戒一月，沐浴更衣，居必易常處。隋開皇中，其國撒哈八撒阿的幹葛思始傳其教入中國。迄元世，其人遍于四方，皆守教不替。

Modena
Modena is the ancestral land of the Huihui (Muslim) people, located near Tianfang. During the Xuande period, its chieftain sent envoys together with those from Tianfang to present tribute, but they did not come again afterward. It is said that their first king, Mohan Mode, was born with divine abilities and subjugated all the Western Regions, being revered by all as "Bianbar," akin to saying "angel." The country has thirty scriptures with over three thousand six hundred sections. Their writings are arranged horizontally and include the seal, cursive, and regular scripts, used by all countries of the Western Oceans. Their religion emphasizes serving heaven as the primary focus without any images. They pray devoutly facing west daily. Annually, they observe a month of fasting, bathing, changing clothes, and living differently from usual. During the Kaihuang era of the Sui dynasty, their religion was first introduced to China by Saha Abbas. By the Yuan dynasty, their people had spread across all regions, all maintaining their religious practices without change.

 國中城池、宮室、市肆、田園，大類中土。有陰陽、星曆、醫藥、音樂諸技。其織文、制器尤巧。寒暑應候，民殷物繁，五穀六畜鹹備。俗重殺，不食豬肉。嘗以白布蒙頭，雖適他邦，亦不易其俗。

In the country, their cities, palaces, markets, and fields are very similar to those in China. They possess various skills in astrology, calendars, medicine, and music. Their weaving and crafting are particularly skillful. The seasons correspond to their climate, the people are prosperous, and goods are abundant, with all five grains and six types of livestock available. They greatly respect life and do not eat pork. They often cover their heads with white cloth, maintaining this custom even when traveling to other countries.

 坤城
坤城，西域回回種。宣德五年，其使臣者馬力丁等來朝，貢駝馬。時有開中之令，使者即輸米一萬六千七百石於京倉中鹽。及辭還，願以所納米獻官。帝曰：「回人善營利，雖名朝貢，實圖貿易，可酬以直。」於是予帛四十匹、布倍之。其後亦嘗貢。

Kun City
Kun City is of the Huihui (Muslim) race in the Western Regions. In the fifth year of Xuande, their envoys, including Malikdin, came to the court, bringing camels and horses as tribute. At that time, there was an order to open central trade, and the envoys immediately delivered 16,700 shi of rice to the capital’s salt warehouse. Upon their departure, they wished to offer the rice they had submitted to the officials. The emperor said, "The Hui people are skilled in trade. Although they name it a tribute, it is actually for trade, and they should be compensated accordingly." Hence, they were given forty bolts of silk and twice that amount in cloth. They later continued to present tribute.

 自成祖以武定天下，欲威制萬方，遣使四出招徠。由是西域大小諸國莫不稽顙稱臣，獻琛恐後。又北窮沙漠，南極溟海，東西抵日出沒之處，凡舟車可至者，無所不屆。自是，殊方異域鳥言侏亻離之使，輻輳闕廷。歲時頒賜，庫藏為虛。而四方奇珍異寶、名禽殊獸進獻上方者，亦日增月益。蓋兼漢、唐之盛而有之，百王所莫並也。餘威及於後嗣，宣德、正統朝猶多重譯而至。然仁宗不務遠略，踐阼之初，即撤西洋取寶之船，停松花江造舟之役，召西域使臣還京，敕之歸國，不欲疲中土以奉遠人。宣德繼之，雖間一遣使，尋亦停止，以故邊隅獲休息焉。

Since Emperor Chengzu unified the empire by force, he sought to exert his influence over all nations, sending envoys far and wide to invite allegiance. As a result, all the countries, large and small, in the Western Regions bowed and paid tribute, fearing to be late. They reached as far north as the desert, as far south as the sea, and as far east and west as the rising and setting sun, wherever boats and carts could reach. Hence, envoys from distant lands with strange languages and peculiar customs gathered at the court. The yearly bestowments exhausted the treasury, while the rare treasures, exotic birds, and animals offered to the emperor increased daily. This surpassed even the prosperity of the Han and Tang dynasties, unrivaled by any other rulers. The lingering influence extended to his successors, with numerous interpreters arriving during the Xuande and Zhengtong periods. However, Emperor Renzong did not pursue distant ambitions. At the beginning of his reign, he withdrew the ships sent to the Western Oceans for treasure, halted the construction of boats on the Songhua River, recalled the Western Region envoys to the capital, and ordered them to return to their countries, unwilling to exhaust the central lands to serve distant peoples. Xuande followed this policy, and although envoys were occasionally sent, it was soon stopped, allowing the borders to rest.

 哈三等二十九部
今采故牘嘗奉貢通名天朝者，曰哈三，曰哈烈兒，曰沙的蠻，曰哈的蘭，曰掃蘭，曰乜克力，曰把力黑，曰俺力麻，曰脫忽麻，曰察力失，曰幹失，曰卜哈剌，曰怕剌，曰你沙兀兒，曰克失迷兒，曰帖必力思，曰火壇，曰火占，曰苦先，曰牙昔，曰牙兒幹，曰戎，曰白，曰兀倫，曰阿端，曰邪思城，曰舍黑，曰擺音，曰克，計二十九部。以疆域褊小，止稱地面。與哈烈、哈實哈兒、賽藍、亦力把力、失剌思、沙鹿海牙、阿速、把丹皆由哈密入嘉峪關，或三年、五年一貢，入京者不得過三十五人。其不由哈密者，更有乞兒、麻米兒、哈蘭可脫、蠟燭、也的幹、剌竹、亦不剌、因格失、迷乞兒、吉思羽奴、思哈辛十一地面，亦嘗通貢。

Twenty-Nine Tribes Including Hasa
According to the records, those who presented tribute to the imperial court included Hasa, Halier, Shademan, Halan, Saolan, Miakeli, Balikehei, Anleima, Tuohuma, Chaleshi, Ganshi, Buhala, Pala, Nishaouer, Kesimier, Tiebelisi, Huotan, Huozhan, Kuxian, Yaxi, Yarugan, Rong, Bai, Wulun, Aduan, Xiesicheng, Shehei, Baiyin, Kejian, totaling twenty-nine tribes. Due to their small territories, they were only referred to as localities. Together with Halie, Hashihaer, Sairan, Yilibali, Shilasi, Shaluhiya, Asu, and Badan, they all entered Jiayuguan through Hami, presenting tribute once every three or five years, with no more than thirty-five people allowed to enter the capital. Those not coming through Hami included Qier, Mamier, Halanketu, Jianlazhu, Yedigan, Lazhu, Yibula, Yinggeshi, Miqier, Jisiyunu, Sihaxin, eleven localities which also occasionally presented tribute.

附 魯迷
魯迷，去中國絕遠。嘉靖三年遣使貢獅子、西牛。給事中鄭一鵬言：「魯迷非嘗貢之邦，獅子非可育之獸，請卻之，以光聖德。」禮官席書等言：「魯迷不列《王會》，其真偽不可知。近土魯番數侵甘肅，而邊吏于魯迷冊內，察有土魯番之人。其狡詐明甚，請遣之出關，治所獲間諜罪。」帝竟納之，而令邊臣察治。

Additional - Lumie
Lumie is extremely distant from China. In the third year of Jiajing, they sent envoys to present lions and western cattle. Censorate official Zheng Yipeng said, "Lumie is not a country that has previously presented tribute, and lions are not animals that can be raised. I request to decline it to highlight the emperor's virtue." Ritual officers Xishu and others said, "Lumie is not listed in the 'Wanghui' (Tribute Records), and its authenticity cannot be verified. Recently, Turfan has invaded Gansu several times, and the border officials found people from Turfan within Lumie's tribute documents. Their deceit is evident, so we request to send them out of the border and punish those found guilty of espionage." The emperor eventually accepted this and ordered the border officials to investigate and handle it.

五年冬，復以二物來貢。既頒賜，其使臣言，長途跋涉，費至二萬二千余金，請加賜。御史張祿言：「華夷異方，人物異性，留人養畜，不惟違物，抑且拂人。況養獅日用二羊，養西牛日用果餌。獸相食與食人食，聖賢皆惡之。又調禦人役，日需供億。以光祿有限之財，充人獸無益之費，殊為拂經。乞返其人，卻其物，薄其賞，明中國聖人不貴異物之意。」不納。乃從禮官言，如弘治撒馬兒罕例益之。

In the fifth year of winter, they again presented the two animals as tribute. After receiving the rewards, the envoys said that the long journey cost more than 22,000 gold, and requested additional rewards. Censorate official Zhang Lu said, "Chinese and foreign lands differ in their customs, and people and animals are different in nature. Keeping people and raising animals not only violates natural principles but also inconveniences people. Besides, feeding lions requires two sheep daily, and feeding western cattle requires fruits and sweets. Animals eating people’s food is detested by sages. Furthermore, managing the animals requires daily labor and expenses. Using the limited resources of the imperial treasury for the useless cost of feeding people and animals is against principles. I request to return the people, decline the animals, and reduce the rewards, to demonstrate that China does not value exotic creatures." This was not accepted. Instead, following the ritual officers’ suggestion, they were rewarded similarly to the example of Samarkand in the Hongzhi period.

二十二年偕天方諸國貢馬及方物，明年還至甘州。會迤北賊入寇，總兵官楊信令貢使九十餘人往禦，死者九人。帝聞，褫信職，命有司棺斂歸其喪。二十七年、三十三年併入貢。其貢物有珊瑚、琥珀、金剛鑽、花瓷器、鎖服、撒哈剌帳、羚羊角、西狗皮、舍列猻皮、鐵角皮之屬。

In the twenty-second year, they, together with envoys from various countries, presented horses and other items as tribute. The following year, they returned to Ganzhou. When bandits from the northern frontier invaded, General Yang Xin ordered over ninety tribute envoys to defend, resulting in nine deaths. Upon hearing this, the emperor dismissed Yang Xin and ordered officials to prepare coffins and return the deceased envoys’ bodies. In the twenty-seventh and thirty-third years, they presented tribute again. Their tribute items included coral, amber, diamonds, floral porcelain, lock garments, Saharan tents, antelope horns, western dog skins, Shalesu skins, and iron horn skins.
