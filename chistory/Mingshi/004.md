The respectful and benevolent Emperor Hui, named Yunwen, was the grandson of the Taizu and the second son of the Crown Prince Yiwen. His mother was Consort Lü. The Emperor was born intelligent and studious, with a nature of utmost filial piety. At the age of fourteen, he attended to the illness of Crown Prince Yiwen, never leaving his side day or night. Two years later, when the Crown Prince passed away, he mourned to the point of emaciation. Taizu comforted him, saying, "Your sincerity in filial piety is pure, but do you not consider my feelings?" In the twenty-fifth year of Hongwu, in September, he was established as the Crown Prince's grandson. In the twenty-ninth year, the ceremonial protocols for the princes' audience with the Eastern Palace were redefined, and after the audience, familial rites were performed in the inner hall, as all the princes were of noble kin. Initially, Taizu had ordered the Crown Prince to review and decide on memorials, and the Crown Prince, being kind-hearted, often reduced sentences in criminal cases. This responsibility was then given to the Crown Prince's grandson, who also assisted with leniency. He once requested Taizu to thoroughly examine the classics on rites and compare them with the penal codes of previous dynasties, resulting in the amendment of seventy-three excessively harsh articles in the Hongwu Code, earning widespread praise for his virtue.

An edict was issued to observe three years of mourning. The ministers requested to shorten the mourning period from years to months. The Emperor replied, "I do not imitate the ancient practice of remaining silent in mourning. In the court, I will wear mourning attire; when I retire, I will use a mourning staff and wear mourning clothes; my meals will be simple porridge; and the rituals at the altars and ancestral temples will follow the usual rites." He then ordered the establishment of the mourning protocols. On the day of Bingshen, an edict was issued for officials of the fifth rank and above, as well as local officials, to recommend worthy individuals, with penalties for those who recommended unworthy persons.

The Prefect of Suzhou, Yao Shan, the Prefect of Ningbo, Wang Jin, the Prefect of Huizhou, Chen Yanhuai, and the Magistrate of Leping, Zhang Yanfang, all raised troops to defend the capital. On the day of Jiachen, Princess Qingcheng was sent to negotiate with Yan's army, discussing the cession of land to cease hostilities.

In June on the day of Guichou, Sheng Yong led a naval force and defeated Yan's troops at Puzikou, but subsequent battles were unsuccessful. Commander Chen Xuan defected to Yan with his naval force. On the day of Yimao, Yan's troops crossed the Yangtze River, and Sheng Yong fought at Gaozigang but was defeated. On the day of Wuwu, the defending general of Zhenjiang, Tong Jun, defected to Yan. On the day of Gengshen, Yan's troops reached Longtan.

或云帝由地道出亡。正統五年，有僧自雲南至廣西，詭稱建文皇帝。思恩知府岑瑛聞於朝。按問，乃鈞州人楊行祥，年已九十餘，下獄，閱四月死。同謀僧十二人，皆戍遼東。自後滇、黔、巴、蜀間，相傳有帝為僧時往來跡。正德、萬曆、崇禎間，諸臣請續封帝後，及加廟諡，皆下部議，不果行。大清乾隆元年，詔廷臣集議，追諡曰恭閔惠皇帝。

Some say the Emperor escaped through an underground passage. In the fifth year of the Zhengtong era, a monk from Yunnan arrived in Guangxi, falsely claiming to be the Jianwen Emperor. The Prefect of Sien, Cen Ying, reported this to the court. Upon investigation, it was found that he was Yang Xingxiang from Junzhou, over ninety years old. He was imprisoned and died after four months. Twelve monks who conspired with him were all exiled to Liaodong. Since then, there have been rumors in Yunnan, Guizhou, Ba, and Shu of the Emperor traveling as a monk. During the Zhengde, Wanli, and Chongzhen eras, officials requested to continue the imperial line and confer a posthumous temple name, but these proposals were always referred to the Ministry and never carried out. In the first year of the Qianlong era of the Qing dynasty, an edict was issued for the court officials to discuss, and he was posthumously named Emperor Gongmin Hui.

贊
　　贊曰：惠帝天資仁厚。踐阼之初，親賢好學，召用方孝孺等。典章制度，銳意復古。嘗因病晏朝，尹昌隆進諫，即深自引咎，宣其疏於中外。又除軍衞單丁，減蘇、松重賦，皆惠民之大者。乃革命而後，紀年復稱洪武，嗣是子孫臣庶以紀載為嫌，草野傳疑，不無訛謬。更越聖朝，得經論定，尊名壹惠，君德用彰，懿哉。

The eulogy states: Emperor Hui was naturally benevolent and kind. At the beginning of his reign, he was close to virtuous and learned men, summoning and employing Fang Xiaoru and others. He was keen on restoring ancient systems and regulations. Once, due to illness, he delayed court sessions, and Yin Changlong admonished him, prompting him to deeply reflect on his faults and publicly announce the admonition. He also abolished the single-soldier households in the military and reduced the heavy taxes in Suzhou and Songjiang, all major acts of benevolence towards the people. However, after the revolution, the era name was reverted to Hongwu, and since then, descendants and officials have been reluctant to record his reign, leading to doubts and inaccuracies in popular accounts. After several dynasties, his name was finally honored and his virtues recognized, truly admirable.
